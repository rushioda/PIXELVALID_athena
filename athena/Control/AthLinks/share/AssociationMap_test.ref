 *** AssociationMap test in progress: 
Build fake data and associations:
Cluster Container...............: 3 clusters
Track Container.................: 3 tracks
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [0,0] with data [1,-1]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [0,1] with data [1,-2]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [0,2] with data [1,-3]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [1,0] with data [2,-1]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [1,1] with data [2,-2]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [1,2] with data [2,-3]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [2,0] with data [3,-1]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [2,1] with data [3,-2]
Associate Clusters and Tracks...: [2,2] with data [3,-3]
List of objects in AssociationMap:
	Cluster : 
		Track : -1
		Track : -2
		Track : -3
	Cluster : 
		Track : -1
		Track : -2
		Track : -3
	Cluster : 
		Track : -1
		Track : -2
		Track : -3
Check that AssociationMap contains myCluster : true
Number of associations for myCluster= 3
Number of association objects:3

 *** Test AssociationMap<TrackContainer,TrackContainer> :
Associate Tracks and Tracks...: [0,1] with data [-1,-2]
Associate Tracks and Tracks...: [0,2] with data [-1,-3]
Associate Tracks and Tracks...: [1,2] with data [-2,-3]
