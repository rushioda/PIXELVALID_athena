/**
 * @brief Object reference supporting deferred reading from StoreGate.
 *
 * This is a kind of smart pointer that can reference objects in StoreGate
 * by key.  This allows deferred-reading semantics, and also allows references
 * to objects that may be in a different physical data file (`back-navigation').
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *@code
 *   DataLink<MyClass> link ("mykey");
 *   ...
 *   // Look up the object `mykey' of class MyClass in StoreGate.
 *   const MyClass* obj = *link;
 @endcode
 *
 * You can also initialize a link directly with a pointer:
 *
 *@code
 *   MyClass* obj = ...;
 *   DataLink<MyClass> link (obj);
 @endcode
 *
 * However, if the object has not been recorded in the event store,
 * the possible operations on the link will be limited.  (In particular,
 * such a link cannot be made persistent.)
 *
 * A @c DataLink can exist in one of three states:
 *
 * - A null reference.
 * - Referring to an object in StoreGate.  In this case, the link refers
 *   to the @c DataProxy for the referred-to object.
 * - Referring to an object directly by pointer.  When you initialize
 *   a link from a pointer, the link will try to find the corresponding
 *   proxy.  However, if one doesn't exist, the link will remember the pointer
 *   directly.  If a subsequent operation is attempted that requires
 *   the proxy (such as @c toPersistent or getting the key) and the object
 *   still isn't in StoreGate, @c SG::ExcPointerNotInSG will be thrown.
 *
 * Internally, a link stores a hashed version of the SG key + CLID;
 * this is the part that's persistent.  (In the case of a link referencing
 * an object not in SG, this field is 0.)  There is also a transient
 * pointer to either the proxy or the object itself (if the object is not
 * in SG).  This latter pointer is factored out as @c DataProxyHolder
 * in order to share implementation with @c ElementLink.  Further, everything
 * which does not depend on the @c STORABLE template parameter, including
 * all the object state, is factored out into the non-templated base class
 * @c DataLinkBase.
 *
 * If the link is being saved directly with ROOT, then @c toPersistent
 * should be called prior to writing.  This will ensure that the
 * hashed StoreGate key is set correctly (and will raise an exception
 * if the link is referencing an object not in SG).  This will also
 * handle any remapping of the link.  When a link is read directly
 * from ROOT, @c toTransient should be called to set the proxy pointer.
 * This would normally be done via a ROOT read rule.
 *
 * A link references objects in a particular event store.
 * When a link is constructed, a global default store is used
 * (see SGTools/CurrentEventStore.h).  If a link is subsequently modified,
 * it stays associated with the same store, unless the link was null
 * or was referencing an object directly by pointer, in which case
 * the global default is again used.  Alternatively, the event
 * store may be passed explicitly using the optional @c sg parameter.
