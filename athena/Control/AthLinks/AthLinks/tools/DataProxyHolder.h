/**
 * @brief Manage @c DataProxy reference in ElementLink/DataLink.
 *
 * This class factors out operations on @c DataProxy that are common
 * between @c ElementLink and @c DataLink, and holds a pointer to the
 * proxy.  This pointer is transient; the (persistent) SG key field
 * is stored in the class that holds this one, and is passed as a parameter
 * where needed.
 *
 * We can be initialized either with a key or with a pointer to an object.
 * In the former case, we try immediately to look up the proxy for that key.
 * If we find it, then we use it; otherwise, we create a dummy @c DataProxy
 * for that key and add it to our store.  If we're given a pointer, we again
 * immediately try to look up the corresponding proxy.  If we don't find it,
 * then we store the pointer directly in the proxy member, with a flag
 * to identify this case.  Subsequent operations that require a proxy
 * will again try to look up the proxy in the store; if that fails,
 * then an exception will be thrown.
 *
 * When we create a new link, the store by default is taken from the
 * global default given by SG::CurrentEventStore::store().
 * This is a thread-specific value, so fetching it can be expensive.
 * If you are creating links inside a loop, it is best to fetch
 * the default before the loop and then passing the result explicitly
 * when you create the links.
