 * @brief An STL vector of pointers that by default owns its pointed-to
 *        elements.
 *
 * For further information, see
 *    <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasComputing/DataVector>
 *
 * Introduction
 * ============
 *
 * A @c DataVector<T> acts like a @c std::vector<T*>, except that it can
 * optionally manage the memory that it contains.  The constructors take
 * an (optional) extra argument, which can be either @c SG::OWN_ELEMENTS
 * or @c SG::VIEW_ELEMENTS (defaulting to @c SG::OWN_ELEMENTS, except for a
 * copy constructor).  This tells whether the @c DataVector owns
 * its contained elements or not.
 *
 * Ownership issues
 * ================
 *
 * If a @c DataVector owns its elements, then they are deleted
 * when the container itself is.  Further, they are deleted by actions
 * which erase elements from the container (i.e, @c erase(), @c pop_back()).
 * A replacement (such as <code> v[0] = new T </code>) will result in the
 * old element being deleted and the container taking ownership
 * of the new element.  It is an error to assign directly between
 * two owning containers (<code>v1[0] = v2[0]</code>).
 * To remove an element from a container and acquire ownership,
 * use @c swapElement.
 *
 * Beware of ownership issues when you modify a @c DataVector.
 * Obviously you should not delete explicitly a @c DataVector element.
 * A @c DataVector should never have two elements pointing to the same object.
 * This may seem obvious but certain std algorithms (e.g. @c remove_if) may 
 * leave a @c DataVector with two copies of the same element in the 
 * "left-over" range.  To avoid a crash when clearing the vector (e.g. in the
 * destructor we have introduced a @f$n\log n@f$ helper function that searches
 * and removes duplicates in the @c DataVector.  This is used by the destructor
 * by @c clear() and by <code>erase(first, last)</code>.  As this may change
 * in the future to improve performance, do not rely on this functionality
 * and do avoid introducing duplicated elements in a @c DataVector.
 *
 * All these cautions do not apply when a @c DataVector it is created with 
 * the flag @c SG::VIEW_ELEMENTS (see <code>enum OwnershipPolicy</code>)
 * and hence does not own its elements. This is typically used
 * to have @c DataVector elements allocated by @c DataPool.
 * Otherwise consider the cleaner alternative of using a @c vector<T*>.
 *
 * The interface for @c DataVector should be mostly compatible with that
 * of @c std::vector.  There are a few differences which should not make
 * much difference in practice.  For example, methods which would
 * return a reference return a proxy object instead.  Also @c value_type
 * is used instead of @c const_reference; this is justified by the fact
 * that the elements are always pointers.
 *
 * Note that algorithms which modify their range may not work
 * correctly if the container owns its contents.  Specializations
 * that work properly for @c DataVector are available for some algorithms.
 * These include:
 *  - @c std::sort
 *  - @c std::stable_sort
 *  - @c std::partial_sort
 *  - @c std::remove
 *  - @c std::remove_if
 *  - @c std::unique
 *  - @c std::reverse
 *  - @c std::rotate
 *  - @c std::random_shuffle
 *  - @c std::partition
 *  - @c std::stable_partition
 *
 * Alternately, for @c sort(), the @c sort() methods defined in @c DataVector
 * may be used.  Or do the sorting in a view @c DataVector
 * or a plain @c std::vector.
 *
 * There are a few other additions to the standard @c std::vector interface.
 *  - The method @c stdcont may be used to get access to the underlying
 *    @c std::vector representation.
 *  - The type @c PtrVector is the type of the underlying @c std::vector.
 *    @c BaseContainer is a synonym for this.
 *  - The method @c swapElement may be used to get ownership of an element
 *    back from a @c DataVector.
 *  - The method @c sort provides an interface
 *    to @c std::sort that works even if the container owns its contents.
 *  - The method @c ownPolicy returns the ownership policy of the container.
 *  - An additional overload of @c clear() is provided that takes as
 *    an argument a new ownership policy for the container.  This is
 *    the only way to change the ownership policy, save for swapping
 *    or moving the container.
 *
 * Note that since @c DataVector\<T> has an element type of @c T*,
 * it is not possible to directly insert a <code>const T*</code>.
 * If you want to do that, see @c ConstDataVector.  (In some cases,
 * such as if the destination container is not being recorded in StoreGate,
 * it may be more appropriate to simply use a
 * <code>std::vector<const T*></code>.)  Don't just use a @c const_cast!
 *
 * Inheritance
 * ===========
 *
 * @c DataVector's may inherit from one another.
 * If you have class @c D which derives from class @c B, you can set things
 * up so that @c DataVector\<D> derives from @c DataVector\<B>.  This allows
 * you do to the same sort of conversions on the @c DataVector's as on the
 * element pointers themselves.  The key to doing this is to add the
 * declaration
 *
 *@code
 *   DATAVECTOR_BASE (D, B);
 @endcode
 *
 * before using @c DataVector\<D>.  A few caveats about doing this.
 * The pointers are actually stored in the base @c DataVector instance,
 * and the type that @c stdcont returns will reflect this.
 * For example, in the example given above, @c DataVector<D>::stdcont()
 * will return a reference to std::vector\<B*>.  Second, in order
 * to preserve the invariant
 * that a @c DataVector\<D> contains only elements that actually derive
 * from @c D, while at the same time not requiring that the contained
 * objects be polymorphic, there is a restriction that you cannot
 * insert into a @c DataVector if you're not referring to it as the
 * most derived type (even if such an insertion would not actually
 * break the invariant).  This is implemented as a runtime check.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *@code
 *   DataVector<D> vd;
 *   vd.push_back (new D);  // This is ok.
 *   vd.push_back (new B);  // This will give a compilation error
 *                             (it would break the invariant).
 *   DataVector<B>& vb = vd;
 *   vb.push_back (new B);  // This will give a run-time error
 *                             (it breaks the invariant).
 *   vb.push_back (new D);  // This will also give a run-time error.
 *                             (It's actually ok, but there's no good way
 *                             to distinguish it from the previous case.)
 @endcode
 *
 * Note also this (related to a common atlas idiom).  If we have the above,
 * and also:
 *
 *@code
 *   class B_Vector : public DataVector<B> { ... };
 *   class D_Vector : public DataVector<D> { ... };
 @endcode
 *
 * Then a @c D_Vector will be convertible to a DataVector\<B>, but _not_
 * to a @c B_Vector.
 *
 * Multiple and virtual inheritance are also supported.  In this case,
 * use <code>DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES</code><em>n</em> (where @e n is 1, 2, or 3)
 * instead of @c DATAVECTOR_BASE.  Example: Given:
 *
 *@code
 *   class M { ... };
 *   class N : virtual public M { ... };
 *   class O : virtual public M { ... };
 *   class P : virtual public N, virtual public O { ... };
 @endcode
 *
 * declare this with
 *
 *@code
 *   DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES1(N, M);
 *   DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES1(O, M);
 *   DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES2(P, N, O);
 @endcode
 *
 * There is a restriction that there must be a unique base class that
 * does not derive from anything else.  For example, the diamond configuration
 * above is ok, but this would not be:
 *
 *@code
 *   class L { ... };
 *   class M { ... };
 *   class N : virtual public M, virtual public L { ... };
 *   class O : virtual public M { ... };
 *   class P : virtual public N, virtual public O { ... };
 *
 *   DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES2(N, M, L);
 *   DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES1(O, M);
 *   DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES2(P, N, O);
 @endcode
 *
 * Note, however, that you don't have to tell @c DataVector about the complete
 * hierarchy; leaving the @c L out of @c DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES would work
 * (you just wouldn't be able to convert to @c DataVector\<L>).
 *
 * If you use @c DATAVECTOR_VIRTBASES, there is an additional time penalty
 * to retrieve elements from the collection.  This does not apply
 * for @c DATAVECTOR_BASES.
 *
 * All applicable @c DATAVECTOR_* macros must be visible at the point at which
 * a @c DataVector is instantiated.  A confusing compilation error is
 * likely to result otherwise.  Note that this means that if you have
 * the @c DATAVECTOR_* macros within a container header file, then
 * the header for the derived container must include the header
 * for the base container.   Be alert to this when converting existing
 * code to use the inheritance scheme.  For example, if class D2 derives
 * from D which derives from B:
 *
 * BVec.h:
 *@code
 *  #include "B.h"
 *  #include "DataVector.h"
 *  typedef DataVector<B> BVec;
 @endcode
 *
 * DVec.h:
 *@code
 *  #include "D.h"
 *  #include "DataVector.h"
 *  DATAVECTOR_BASE(D,B);
 *  typedef DataVector<D> DVec;
 @endcode
 *
 * D2Vec.h:
 *@code
 *  #include "D2.h"
 *  #include "DataVector.h"
 *  #include "DVec.h" // This is required
 *  DATAVECTOR_BASE(D2,D);
 *  typedef DataVector<D2> DVec;
 @endcode
 *
 * Using @c DATAVECTOR_BASE will also set up the corresponding @c SG::BaseInfo
 * definitions, both for the vectors themselves and for the contained objects.
 *
 * Auxiliary data
 * ==============
 *
 * A @c DataVector may also have `auxiliary data' associated with it.
 * This is a set of name/value pairs that can be attached to each element
 * of the vector.  These data are stored in vectors that exist parallel
 * to the @c DataVector; the exact way in which this managed is hidden
 * behind an abstract interface.
 *
 * We'll start with an example, and then go into more detail.
 *
 *@code
 *
 * class MyClass
 *   : public SG::AuxElement  // Derive from AuxElement to allow for aux data
 * {
 * public:
 *   // A getter for an aux data item.
 *   float foo() const
 *   { const static ConstAccessor<float> acc ("foo");  return acc(*this); }
 *
 *   // A setter for an aux data item.
 *   void foo(float x)
 *   { const static Accessor<float> acc ("foo");  acc(*this) = x; }
 * };
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Create the vector and associate a store.
 * DataVector<MyClass>* v = new DataVector<MyClass>;
 * SG::AuxStoreInternal* store = new SG::AuxStoreInternal;
 * v->setStore (store);
 *
 * // Add an item to the vector and set aux data on it.
 * v->push_back (new MyClass);
 * v[0]->foo() = 3;
 *
 * // Add a user-defined aux data item.
 * MyClass::Accessor<int> x ("x");
 * x(*v[0]) = 10;
 *
 * // Add a standalone store to an object.
 * MyClass* c = new MyClass;
 * c->makePrivateStore();
 * c->foo() = 4;
 * c->push_back (c); // Aux data will be transferred to the container.
 @endcode
 *
 * In order to be able store auxiliary data in a container three things
 * must hold.  First, the container's payload type must derive from
 * @c SG::AuxElement.  Second, the container must have index tracking
 * enabled.  Third, the container must have an associated auxiliary
 * data store.  More about these below.
 *
 * SG::AuxElement
 * --------------
 *
 * A type which may have associated auxiliary data must derive from the base
 * class @c SG::AuxElement.  This does a several things.
 *
 * First, in order to be able to find auxiliary data from a pointer to
 * a container element, the element must be able to know both the container
 * that it's a member of and its index within that container.
 * @c SG::AuxElement makes this information available with the @c container()
 * and @c index() methods.  This information is maintained as long as the
 * container has index tracking enabled (see below).
 *
 * Second, it provides an interface for getting/setting auxiliary data.
 * The recommended way of doing this is through the nested @c Accessor
 * and @c ConstAccessor classes; these allows caching the translation
 * from attribute names to the internal representation.  The difference
 * between these two is that @c ConstAccessor allows only const access
 * to the element, while @c Accessor, which derives from it,
 * allows non-const access as well.  Create an @c Accessor
 * or @c ConstAccessor object with the data type (which can be anything
 * that can be used within a @c std::vector) and a name.  For @c Accessor,
 * the resulting object can then be used both as an rvalue and a lvalue;
 * for @c ConstAccessor, it can be used only as an rvalue.
 *
 *@code
 *  MyClass* c = ...;
 *  MyClass::Accessor<double> y ("y");
 *  y(*c) = 4;  // assign attribute.
 *  return y(*c);  // read attribute.
 @endcode
 *
 * A given name must always be used with the same type, otherwise an exception
 * will be thrown.  In the case that you want to use the same name for
 * different types in different classes, the name may be qualified with
 * an optional class name:
 *
 *@code
 *  MyClass::ConstAccessor<double> y ("y", "MyClass");
 @endcode
 *
 * If you have some auxiliary data items that are to be regarded as members
 * of a class, it is recommended to define a setter and getter as in the
 * example above.
 *
 * If you need to operate on a particular auxiliary data item for all elements
 * in a container, it will be more efficient to access the auxiliary data
 * directly by index, rather than through the elements.  This can be done like:
 *
 *@code
 *  DataVector<MyClass>* v = ...;
 *  MyClass::ConstAccesor<float> x ("x");
 *  size_t sz = v->size();
 *  for (size_t i = 0; i < sz; i++)
 *    do_something (x(*v, i));
 @endcode
 *
 * @c Accessor and @c ConstAccessor also have @c getDataArray methods
 * to directly return a pointer to the start of the auxiliary data array.
 *
 * It is also possible to use the @c auxdata method to access auxiliary
 * data directly.  However, it is not recommended to do this inside a loop
 * or anywhere where performance is important.
 *
 *@code
 *  c->auxdata<int> ("aux") = 5;  // set
 *  return c->auxdata<int> ("aux");  // retrieve
 @endcode
 *
 * Decorations
 * -----------
 *
 * In addition, sometimes one wants to add additional auxiliary data to
 * an existing, const container; this is called `decorating' it.
 * For example, you might want to retrieve a const container from StoreGate,
 * run some algorithm on it, and attach additional data to the object
 * that can be accessed by downstream algorithms or written to a file.
 * To support this, there is a @c Decorator object analogous to @c Accessor
 * and @c ConstAccessor.  The difference is that @c Decorator can operate
 * on a const object and return a non-const reference.
 *
 * To prevent modifying existing data, the contents of a container
 * may be locked with the @c lock() call; this happens automatically
 * when the container is made const with @c StoreGateSvc::setConst.
 * Once a container is locked, @c Decorator will only succeed
 * if either the variable does not yet exist (in which case it is
 * created and marked as a decoration) or it is marked as a decoration.
 *
 * Calling @c clearDecorations will erase all variables marked as decorations,
 * restoring the state back to where it was when @c lock was called.
 *
 * An @c auxdecor method is also available, analogous to @x auxdata.
 *
 *
 * Index tracking
 * --------------
 *
 * Recall that a @c DataVector either owns its elements or not.
 * By default, a @c DataVector that owns its elements will update
 * the container and index fields of the elements that it contains,
 * while a view @c DataVector will not.
 *
 * This rule does not always suffice, though.  In particular, a @c DataVector
 * that gets filled with elements from a @c DataPool does not own its
 * elements but should track indices.  For this reason, one can specify
 * an index tracking policy separate from the ownership policy.  Where
 * @c DataVector takes an ownership policy, it can also take as the
 * next argument an index tracking policy.  This policy defaults to
 * @c SG::DEFAULT_TRACK_INDICES, which means to set the indexing
 * policy based on the ownership policy.  But it can also be set to
 * @c SG::ALWAYS_TRACK_INDICES or @c SG::NEVER_TRACK_INDICES
 * to override this.
 *
 * The current state of index tracking for a @c DataVector is returned
 * by the @c trackIndices method.  Like the ownership policy, it may
 * be changed with the @c clear method.
 *
 * Auxiliary store
 * ---------------
 *
 * @c DataVector does not itself manage the storage for auxiliary data.
 * Instead, this is done by a separate _auxiliary store_ object.
 * This store object implements either the interface @c SG::IConstAuxStore
 * or @c SG::IAuxStore (which derives from it).  The first of these
 * provides operations needed to read data from the store, while the
 * second adds operations needed to add to and modify the data in the store.
 *
 * When you are create a @c DataVector object that is to have
 * auxiliary data, you will also need to create the store object.
 * A generic store object, which manages dynamic auxiliary data,
 * is available, @c SG::AuxStoreInternal.  There may also be specialized
 * store implementations for particular data classes.  Store implementations
 * also exist that are specialized for use in root; in that case, the data
 * are managed as part of a root tree, and the store object manages
 * access to it.
 *
 *@code
 *  DataVector<MyClass>* v = new DataVector<MyClass>;
 *  CHECK( evtStore->record (v, "mykey") );
 *  SG::AuxStoreInternal* store = new SG::AuxStoreInternal;
 *  CHECK( evtStore->record (store, "mykeyAux.") );
 *  v->setStore (store);
 @endcode
 *
 * You can only set a store if the container has index tracking enabled;
 * otherwise, an exception will be thrown.
 *
 * You should not have to explicitly deal with the auxiliary store
 * for objects that are read from a file.  The I/O system is responsible
 * for getting the store association correct in that case.
 *
 * Standalone objects
 * ------------------
 *
 * Normally, an element can only have associated auxiliary data if it is
 * a member of a container; otherwise, there is no store in which to store
 * the auxiliary data.  However, it is possible to request that a store
 * be created for an individual element not part of a container by calling
 * the method @c makePrivateStore.  You can then add auxiliary data to the
 * object:
 *
 *@code
 *  MyClass* c = new MyClass;
 *  c->makePrivateStore();
 *  MyClass::Accessor<int> x ("x");
 *  x(*c) = 5;
 @endcode
 *
 * If the element is then added to a container, the auxiliary data will be
 * copied to the container's store, and the private store the was associated
 * with the element will be released.  The fact that there was a private store
 * is remembered, however; if the element is later removed from the container
 * (in a way that doesn't delete the element), the private store will be remade
 * and the auxiliary data copied back from the container to the private store.
 *
 * @c makePrivateStore can also take an argument.  If provided, auxiliary data
 * will be copied from it.  This can be used to properly implement copy
 * constructors:
 *
 *@code
 *  class MyStandaloneClass
 *    : public SG::AuxElement
 *  {
 *  public:
 *    MyStandaloneClass() { this->makePrivateStore(); }
 *
 *    MyStandaloneClass (const MyStandaloneClass& other)
 *      SG::AuxElement (other)
 *    {
 *      this->makePrivateStore (other);
 *    }
 @endcode
 *
 * As a shorthand, one can use the wrapper class @c SG::AuxElementComplete.
 * This will add constructors that automatically make a private store:
 *
 *@code
 *  typedef SG::AuxElementComplete<MyClass> MyStandaloneClass;
 @endcode
 *
 * A standalone object also has @c setStore methods that can be used
 * to associate an external store with a since object, in the same manner
 * as for containers.
