/**
 * @brief Proxy for lvalue access to @c DataVector/@c DataList elements.
 *
 * We need to be careful with lvalue references to @c DataVector/List elements.
 * If the @c DataVector/List owns its elements, then if we write into the
 * @c DataVector/List via an lvalue, the old element should be deleted
 * (and the @c DataVector/List then takes ownership of the new value).
 * We implement this by having the lvalue references return a proxy
 * object rather than a raw reference.  The proxy handles
 * ownership issues.  To do this, the proxy stores a pointer
 * to the original container.
 *
 * When inheritance is used with @c DataVector/List, we have the additional
 * restriction that we can only write into the @c DataVector/List using
 * the most-derived @c DataVector/List class.  We also need to enforce that
 * in @c ElementProxy when there's an attempt to write via an lvalue.
 * We can also get this information from the original container.
