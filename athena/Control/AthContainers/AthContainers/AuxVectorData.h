/**
 * @brief Manage lookup of vectors of auxiliary data.
 *
 * An object, usually a @c DataVector, can have vectors of auxiliary
 * data associated with it.  This class manages this association.
 *
 * An auxiliary data item is identified by an integer of type
 * @c SG::auxid_t.  The @c getData methods can be used to get
 * a reference to one auxiliary data element given the @c auxid
 * and the vector index.  However, @c getData does not do type checking,
 * so it should generally not be used.  (Use instead the @c Accessor
 * or @c ConstAccessor classes defined in @c AuxElement.)
 *
 * The auxiliary data is not managed by this class, but rather by
 * a separate `aux store' class, to which we hold a pointer.
 * Actually, there can be two pointers.  We define two interfaces
 * for an aux store, @c IConstAuxStore, which defines operations
 * for accessing data read-only, and @c IAuxStore, which defines
 * operations for modifying data.  If we have a const store,
 * only the pointer to the const interface is set; if we have
 * non-const store, then both pointers are set (to the same object).
 *
 * To speed up access to aux data, we cache pointers to the start
 * of the data for each vector.  There are separate caches
 * for const and non-const pointers.  If you make any changes
 * to the aux store behind the back of this container object,
 * you should call @c clearCache.
 *
 * We also support adding `decorations' to a const container.  These are
 * new auxiliary data items that don't conflict with existing ones.
 * See IConstAuxStore for more information.
 *
 * Notes on thread safety:
 *
 * It's a little tricky to make this class thread-safe without spoiling
 * the optimizations in getDataArray.  This section outlines some of the
 * considerations that went into the chosen solution.
 *
 * First, by `thread-safe', we mean that getDataArray can be called
 * in different threads without problems.  This is necessary to allow
 * simultaneous reads of the container.  We make no attempt to any
 * synchronization on modifications to the container, such as adding elements.
 * Such operations must be synchronized externally.  This is the same
 * sort of thread semantics that the STL containers supply.  So our
 * considerations of thread-safety involve only the management
 * of the cache vector.
 *
 * Second, reads (of the cache vector) are very common (and inlined),
 * while modifications of it are uncommon (and handled by out-of-line code).
 * Thus, we would like reading to be entirely lock-free.  If we need
 * to make modifications, though, we can do whatever locking we need.
 * Making the reader lock-free, though, is complicated by the fact
 * that the cache vector may relocate in memory if is expanded.
 *
 * A way forward is suggested by read-copy-update (RCU) synchronization.
 * The idea there is that when you want to change some structure,
 * you copy it and work on the copy.  When the modifications are done,
 * the new structure is copied to the old one in such a manner that
 * at any instant in time, any reader will see a consistent version
 * of the structure (even though it may not be the most recent one).
 *
 * For this case, we can store the vector as a length and a pointer
 * to the beginning.  When we want to access AUXID, we first
 * compare it to the length.  If that's ok, then we test the
 * pointer at index AUXID.  If that's non-null, we go ahead and use it;
 * if either test fails, we go to the out-of-line code.
 *
 * The out-of-line code can then take out a lock and will in the new
 * pointer in the vector.  If it is necessary to expand the the vector,
 * we allocate a new one and copy the old vector to the new one.
 * Then we update the values: first, the pointer, then the length.
 * This ensures that the inline code will always see something
 * consistent.  Then we must delay freeing the old vector until we're
 * sure that no thread can possibly be using it anymore.  For now,
 * we just avoid deleting the old vectors until the container itself
 * is deleted; the memory wasted by this should be negligible in the
 * context of reconstruction.
 *
 * This allows the inline part of the code to avoid locking.  However,
 * there is an additional critical detail.  We have a test like this:
 *
 *  m_cache_length <= auxid || !m_cache[auxid]
 *
 * As long as the length is read before the cache pointer itself,
 * everything's fine, even if those reads were some time in the past.
 * But if the reads can be in the other order, we could face disaster.
 * While the short-circuit operator should prevent the array indexing
 * from happening before the length is read, there is nothing a priori
 * to prevent a speculative read of m_cache before the length.  For the
 * cognoscenti, this is a `control dependency' (rather than a `data dependency'),
 * which implies no ordering guarantees.
 *
 * Now, we can deal with this by inserting a read barrier between the two loads.
 * That should be correct in all cases.  However, that tends to destroy
 * the optimization below for repeated references to the same aux data item
 * (see the use of @c ATHCONTAINERS_ASSUME in @c getDataArray in the icc file).
 *
 * It turns out that on x86 machines, memory ordering guarantees are relatively
 * strong.  In particular, loads cannot be reordered with other loads,
 * and stores from one CPU are seen in the same order by all other CPUs.
 * So in this case, no barrier is actually needed --- provided that the
 * compiler emits the loads in the correct order.  The supported way
 * to do this with gcc is to use `asm volatile ("":::"memory")' --- however,
 * that explicitly clobbers member, which again spoils our optimization.
 *
 * While it seems unlikely that the compiler would actually find it worthwhile
 * to reorder the loads on an x86 machine, some extra safety would be nice.
 * We try to prevent this reordering by adding an explicit data dependency.
 * Instead of a single m_cache pointer, we have an array of two pointers
 * (which will be identical) and use m_cache[m_cache_len&1].  This
 * provides an explicit data dependency which should prevent reading the
 * pointer before the length; the cost is an added and operation and adding
 * an index register to the dereference operation.
 *
 * Actually, this is not completely watertight; the compiler could in principle
 * decide to speculate the reads of both pointers, or speculate one and
 * then throw it away if it guessed wrong.  This seems sufficiently unlikely
 * to be an issue that we'll live with it for now --- though it might
 * be worth having something to validate the generated code.
