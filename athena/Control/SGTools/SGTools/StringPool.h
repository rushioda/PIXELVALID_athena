/**
 * @file  SGTools/StringPool.h
 * @author scott snyder
 * @date Mar 2007
 * @brief Maintain a mapping of strings to 64-bit ints.
 *
 * We map from strings to integer keys using a hash function.
 * We keep a table of hashed strings so that we can later return the string
 * given the key.
 * We allow registering additional key->string mappings as well, as long
 * as there aren't collisions.
 * We also keep an auxiliary int that gets hashed along with the string.
