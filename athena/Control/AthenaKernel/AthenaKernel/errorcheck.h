 * @file  errorcheck.h
 * @author scott snyder <snyder@bnl.gov>
 * @date Jan, 2006
 * @brief Helpers for checking error return status codes and reporting errors.
 *
 * A typical sequence of code for calling something in Atlas that
 * returns a StatusCode looks something like this:
 *
 *@code
 *  StatusCode sc = something();
 *  if (! sc.isSuccess() ) {
 *    log << "Some error message" << endmsg;
 *    return sc;
 *  }
 @endcode
 *
 * This has several undesireable properties.  First, it is overly verbose.
 * 80% of the code in this example is devoted to error handling; if there
 * are many of these, it becomes difficult to read what the code is
 * actually doing.
 *
 * Second, there is no standardization of the error messages produced,
 * and they are sometimes difficult to trace back to the actual offending
 * source code.
 *
 * Third, code like this typically gets written by cut-and-paste,
 * which is notoriously error-prone.
 *
 * This header defines some helpers to address these issues.
 *
 * For the simple case, you can use the macro @c CHECK.  This macro
 * encapsulates the actions shown in the example above; it could be
 * rewritten as
 *
 *@code
 *  CHECK( something() );
 @endcode
 *
 * The error message produced by this will contain the text of the
 * expression that failed, the failed @c StatusCode, the source file
 * and line, the name of the containing function, and the
 * algorithm/tool/service name.  Note that in order to get this
 * last name, the macro uses the @c this pointer; this means that this
 * macro cannot be used in contexts where @c this is not available.
 * In this case, use the macro @c CHECK_WITH_CONTEXT, which allows
 * an explicit specification of the context name:
 *
 *@code
 *  CHECK_WITH_CONTEXT( something(), "algname" );
 @endcode
 *
 * In some cases, a simple check of the @c StatusCode is not enough and
 * @c CHECK cannot be used.  One can still avail oneself of the standardized
 * error reporting provided here with the macro
 * @c REPORT_ERROR, which takes a @c StatusCode as an argument.
 * Additional text can be added with the output streaming operator,
 * as for @c MsgStream.  (No need to use @c endmsg.)
 *
 *@code
 *  StatusCode sc = something();
 *  if ( ! sc.isSuccess() && ! failure_is_ok ) {
 *    REPORT_ERROR (sc) << "something()";
 *    return sc;
 *  }
 @endcode
 *
 * This will report the same kind of error as @c CHECK would.
 *
 * @c CHECK will return the failing status code to the caller and log the
 * appropriate type of error message.  If you need to control what gets
 * returned to the caller, you can use @c CHECK_RECOVERABLE and
 * @c CHECK_FATAL (and the corresponding @c _WITH_CONTEXT) versions.
 * If these macros detect a failure, they always return a @c RECOVERABLE
 * or @c FATAL status to the caller, respectively.  In addition,
 * @c CHECK_CODE and @c CHECK_CODE_WITH_CONTEXT may be used to return
 * an arbitrary status code to the caller.
 *
 * Like @c CHECK, @c REPORT_ERROR requires that @c this be available.
 * If this is not the case, then as before there is also a macro
 * @c REPORT_ERROR_WITH_CONTEXT that takes the context name explicitly:
 *
 *@code
 *  StatusCode sc = something();
 *  if ( ! sc.isSuccess() && ! failure_is_ok ) {
 *    REPORT_ERROR_WITH_CONTEXT (sc, "algname") << "something()";
 *    return sc;
 *  }
 @endcode
 *
 * In addition, there are @c REPORT_MESSAGE and @c REPORT_MESSAGE_WITH_CONTEXT
 * macros.  These do not take a @c StatusCode argument, but do take
 * a logging level argument, so you can emit messages other than errors.
 * Example:
 *
 *@code
 *   REPORT_MESSAGE (MSG::INFO) << "Something happened."
 @endcode
 *
 * In the case where you want to change the source line, file, function, etc.,
 * from what's provided by default, you can instantiate an instance of
 * @c errorcheck::ReportMessage directly.  This may also be used
 * if you need to use multiple statements to generate the output message.
 * The message will be issued when then object is destroyed.  Example:
 *
 *@code
 *   {
 *     errorcheck::ReportMessage msg (MSG::INFO, ERRORCHECK_ARGS, "context");
 *     msg << "testing ";
 *     for (int i=1; i<=3; i++)
 *       msg << i << " ";
 *   }
 @endcode
