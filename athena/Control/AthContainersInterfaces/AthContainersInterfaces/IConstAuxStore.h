/**
 * @brief Interface for const operations on an auxiliary store.
 *
 * A @c DataVector may have auxiliary data associated with it.
 * These data are kept in separate AuxStore objects; this defines
 * the interface for const operations on such a store.
 *
 * An AuxStore may store a number of different aux data items;
 * these are identified by an integer of type @c auxid_t.
 * Each item is stored as a vector with one entry per entry
 * in the containing @c DataVector.
 *
 * This interface provides methods for getting a const pointer
 * to an existing vector of aux data items and for getting the set
 * of existing aux data items.
 *
 * In addition, sometimes we want to add additional auxiliary data to
 * an existing, const container; this is called `decorating' it.
 * For example, we retrieve a const container from StoreGate,
 * run some algorithm on it, and attach additional data to the object
 * that can be accessed by downstream algorithms or written to a file.
 * To support this, we add the @c getDecoration operation, as well
 * as @c lock and @c clearDecorations.  When the object is first
 * being filled, it is unlocked.  It gets locked when @c StoreGateSvc::setConst
 * is called on it.  From then on, we can only create decorations.
 * Calling @c clearDecorations will restore the state back to where
 * it was when @c lock was called.  (Be sure that the container's
 * cache also gets cleared.)
 *
 * @c getDecoration then works as follows:
 * 
 *  - If the item doesn't exist, then it will be created.  If the container
 *    is locked, then the new item will be marked as a decoration.
 *  - If the item already exists, then we allow access only if either
 *    the container is not locked or the item is marked as a decoration.
