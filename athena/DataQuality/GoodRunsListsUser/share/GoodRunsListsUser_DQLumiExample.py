## This Athena job consists of algorithms that loop over events;
## here, the (default) top sequence is used:
from AthenaCommon.AlgSequence import AlgSequence, AthSequencer
job = AlgSequence()
seq = AthSequencer("AthFilterSeq")

## AthFilterSeq is always executed before the top sequence, and is configured such that
## any follow-up sequence (eg. top sequence) is not executed in case GRLTriggerAlg1 does
## not pass the event
## In short, the sequence AthFilterSeq makes sure that all algs in the job sequence
## are skipped when an event gets rejects
