contains makefile and src to build the hcg executable, for 
writing tamplate han config files from input root files ...

Usage: hcg [OPTIONS] input1.root ... inputN.root

    -o                FILENAME  	name of output (filename required)
    -b,   --base      DIR       	use directory DIR as the base for the han config
    -d,   --dir       DIR       	only directories below DIR where DIR is a structure such as HLT/TRIDT etc
    -x,   --exclude   DIR       	exclude directory DIR
    -s,   --slice     SLICE     	trigger signature name (for comments)
    -r,   --remap     SRC DST   	remap directory SRC to directory DST
    -a,   --algorithm VALUE     	use VALUE as the execution algorithm for each histogram
    -af,  --algfile   FILENAME  	read algorithm information from FILENAME
    -ds,  --desc      DESCRIP   	use DESCRIP as the description
    -df,  --descfile  FILENAME  	read descriptions from FILENAME
    -dp,  --dispfile  FILENAME  	read display information from FILENAME
    -t,   --tag       VALUE     	add the VALUE to the list of command per histogram
    -wc,  --wildcard            	print use hist * rather than a separate entry for each histogram
    -wf,  --wcfile    FILENAME  	read list of directories to wildcard from a file
    -wd,  --wcdir     DIR=ALG   	add wildcard for DIRECTORY using ALG for the algorithm
    -dr,  --deleteref           	delete unselected histograms
    -or,  --outref   FILENAME   	file to write reduced output to (overwrites input otherwise) 
    -rh,  --relocate            	relocate selected histograms
    -ref, --reference TAG FILE  	add FILE as a reference file with tag TAG
    -rc,  --refconf       FILE  	add FILE to the config as a reference block
    -v,   --verbose             	print verbose output
    -h,   --help                	display this help




for instance ...

%  hcg  hid_shifter.root  -d HLT/TRIDT -x TestMon -o  hc.config

will take the directory structure in file eg

  hid_shifter.root

and generate a config from the directory structure hanging from 

  run_253124/HLT/TRIDT

generating the config using HLT (ie the first directory in HLT/TRIDT ) 
as the base directory, and excluding any directory with the name 
"TestMon"

To remap a name, eg suppose you have the directory SOME_STUFF in the file, 
but want this to correspond to a menu side bar item of NICE, then including 
options

 -r SOME_STUFF NICE

should do this. Any number of remappings of this sort should be possible...

 -r SOME_STUFF NICE  -r ANOTHER EVEN_NICER

The option 

   --deleteref

will delete the histograms that are not selected, so do check the 
provided configuration before using this option. It does save the
original file in FILEMAN.bak however for emergencies


There are options to be able to specify algorithms, and descriptions 
for specific histograms from a file. Using a c++ like format file 
with options such as 

SomeHistogram = SomeAlgorithm&GetherData ;

Comments starting with // are allowed.
The layout can be free formatted.

** NB: If a config output file in not given in the command line it writes **
**     the config to stdout, and all other documentation and debugging    **
**     information is written to stderr                                     **

Adding custom algorithms, descriptions or display options
-----------------------------------------------------------

If one has for instance some histogram that require a custom or specific 
algorithm, description of display option, eg ...

   dir HLT_j110_gsc150_boffperf_split {

	   dir InDetTrigTrackingxAODCnv_BjetPrmVtx_FTF_SuperRoi {

		  hist Chain {

			    algorithm   	= HLT_SomeAlgorithm

			    description 	= https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/HltTrackingDataQualityMonitoring#Tier0

			    output      	= HLT/TRIDT/Bjet/Expert/HLT_j110_gsc150_boffperf_split/InDetTrigTrackingxAODCnv_BjetPrmVtx_FTF_SuperRoi

			    display     	= StatBox

                  }
           }
   }

Then specifying a file, algfile.txt, containing eg

  Chain = HLT_someAlgorithm;

and then running

% hcg HIST.root  ...  --algfile algfile.txt  ...

would substitue the relevant algorithm for all histograms named "Chain".

The histgram configuration can have as many sub directories, as required  such as

  HLT_j110_gsc150_boffperf_split/InDetTrigTrackingxAODCnv_BjetPrmVtx_FTF_SuperRoi/Chain = some_algorithm ;

for very fine grained replacement.

In addition, wildcarding in the histogram specification is allowed, for instance ...

  HLT_j.*/.*_FTF_SuperRoi/Chain = some_algorithm ;

but exquisite care need be taken if using this feature, since if multiple patterns 
in the alg file match a given histogram, it is not well definied which pattern would 
end up being used.

Generally the pattern matching proceeds from the histogram, to the next directory
up, then the next etc.

It does however, first check against any exact matches which *do not* contain 
any wildcards before looking for a pattern match so that a pattern match will not 
override the configuration for a specifically identifed histogram.

This exact same approach also works for the different "display" options for a 
histogram using the --dispfile option, and also for the "description" files, 
using the --descfile option.

With the --descfile option, the provided descriptions must be in quotes, "", eg

  HLT_j.*/.*_FTF_SuperRoi/Chain = "This is the FTF processing for a superRoi chain" ;

These configuration files can be freely formatted and comments are allowed of the form

   // a comment on specific histogram description
   Histogram = "some description" ; // yes, this is also a comment

Lines must be terminated with a semi-colon: ;


Wildcarding of histogram names
-------------------------------

The command line option 

  -wc

will wildcard all the histograms in all directories.

For more fine grained control, the option

    -wd,  --wcdir   DIR=ALG   add wildcard for DIRECTORY using ALG for the algorithm

such the eg 

% hcg ... -wd "Bjet.*Shift.* = Bjet_shifter_algorithm" 

will set "all_in_dir" for all directories that match Bjet.*Shift.* and will additionally
set the algorithm for these to be Bjet_shifter_algorithm.

As many instances of -wd as required can be used on the command line, but to 
ease the case where a large number of such directories are require, there is also 
the option 
   
 -wf,  --wcfile    FILENAME  	read list of directories to wildcard from a file

which will read the patterns from a file.

This file has the same format as the algorithm files, ie it can be free formatted, 
contain comments etc.
