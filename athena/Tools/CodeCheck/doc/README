package CodeCheck

author Albrand Solveig <albrand@isn.in2p3.fr>
##########################################################################
Version 01-00-02
# added undocumented option -Zall
Version 01-01-00
# added the rulechecker tool (10 december 2002)
Version 01-00-01
# changed codewizard config file name from .psrc to psrc
Version 01-00-00 
## Limited Check of Atlas C++ coding rules using CodeWizard from Parasoft.
###############################################
# See the following page for complete details
http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/SOFTWARE/OO/Development/qa/Tools/
# Pre-Conditions:
Your code should compile without error. (but see below)
# rulechecker is a code verifier. It is not yet complete, but it is tailored for
Atlas coding rules.
# codewizard is a code verifier. It tests a different set of rules, but
currently cannot cope with part of the Boost Library which is used by Storegate

# Execution (from the ..../cmt directory of your package):
codewizard : 

 gmake codewizard
 
 Note that codewizard has been configured NOT to call the compiler after its
 own execution
 
rulechecker:

 gmake rulechecker
 
# Output :
codewizard : (one file per package)
 The file is called $(CODECHECK_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)/$(version).cwrpt
 e.g. LArBookkeeping-00-00-05.cwrpt.
 
 rulechecker: (one file per cxx source file)
 $(CODECHECK_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)/$(name).viol
 
 By default the output goes into ../CodeCheck/[codewizard|rulechecker]. 
 You can override this
 (see web page referenced above)

More details on codewizard
#######################################################
 This package is called CodeCheck.
 It was originally for the now obsolete "CodeCheck" tool
 Version 01-00-00 installs a limited version of "codewizard" from Parasoft.

In the  ../rules directory

 
 in ../rules are the definition of the rules to be applied by codewizard
 (1)	The "user defined rules" *.rule. These are specific Atlas rules.
 (2)	And a textfile which lists the user defined rules which will be applied
 (3)	There should be at least a file called by default ".psrc" which is the configuration for codewizard.


 The configuration file ../rules/.psrc should contain :
 (1)
	The definition of the default output file - which is be overruled by an option
	on the above line " -Zoi "report_file filename""	
 	
 (2) The enumeration of codewizard built-in rules which we want to use. 22 of
 the Atlas rules are concerned.
 (3) The definition of other rules that codewizard will include
	(optional rules and home-made rules)
    i.e. gives the name of the text file containing the list


#####################################################
	
 The lxplus path is  "/pttools/CodeWizard/codewizard/lib.linux2"
 
 codewizard must be installed on the host machine 
 and the execution called in the make file fragment is
 
 ${CODECHECK}/codewizard
#############################################################
The paths  to find the tool:
 If you are running on lxplus there is no problem.
Codewizard is installed. Otherwise you must install it, and override the
following macros.
####################################################
macro CODECHECK_TOP ""\
	CERN "/pttools/CodeWizard/codewizard"
	
macro ARCH ""\
	Linux "linux2"
# not done for SOLARIS	
	
	
macro CODECHECK "${CODECHECK_TOP}/bin.${ARCH}"


NOTE:
Code parsers are not perfect, and their output should be taken merely as a useful
guide.
################################
#
14/03/02 - added option -Zall
It turns out that the codewizard parser can sometimes spot things incorrect code
that the compiler has passed. By default, codewizard does not tell you when it
does this, it just produces no output.
The option -Zall will tell you that there is a parsing problem, which may
indicate an obscure error in the C++ code.

More details on rulechecker
rulechecker is installed in the common LCG dist area at CERN.
/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/contrib/rulechecker
This directory also contains the complete userGuide.
For installing at other sites please consult Solveig Albrand.
The web site referenced above contains the list of Atlas Rules currently
checked.
Some parsing problems remain.
