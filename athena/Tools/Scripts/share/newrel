# Simply change the ATLASDistArea and CMTDefault to point to where kits (or releases) are
# installed at your site. Also appropriately set "CMTSite". You may also change the default
# CVSROOT by specifying one below. Examples of more customization at the bottom of this
# script.
# 
#
# Wishlist: write a cleaner version in python!
