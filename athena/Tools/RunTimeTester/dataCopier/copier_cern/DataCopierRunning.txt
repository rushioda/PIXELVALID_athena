Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The RTT data copier is a set of scripts which scan a given release for 
configuration files from which it collects the datasets. It then compares 
the datasets requested with those available in the catalog. If any new data 
are found, it copies these to a local disk and updates the catalog. At the 
end of the process, it writes a report to a specified directory.

Features
========

The data copier uses two configuration files:
 - An RTT top level configuration file
 - A copier specific configuration file
to know what actions it needs to perform.

A sample RTT top level configuration file is available at
http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/atlas/AtlasTesting/RTTUserGuide/RTTUserGuide.html
Go to section on LocalRunning and install the setup files as indicated.
Please read the RTT documentation at
http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/atlas/AtlasTesting  
if you need more information on this configuration file and the RTT

A sample copier specific configuration file looks like:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<dsmcfg>
   <mode>active</mode>
   <datasetCatalog>/afs/user/scratch0/Tools/RunTimeTester/dataCopier/copier_cern/cfg/rttDatasetCatalog.xml</datasetCatalog>
   <rttsrc>/afs/cern.ch/user/e/enzuobon/scratch0/Tools/RunTimeTester/src</rttsrc>
   <rttLibDir>/afs/cern.ch/atlas/project/RTT/prod/Tools/RunTimeTester/share</rttLibDir>
   <logDir>/afs/cern.ch/user/e/enzuobon/scratch0</logDir>
   <reportDir>/afs/cern.ch/user/e/enzuobon/scratch0</reportDir>
   <rttcfg>/afs/cern.ch/atlas/project/RTT/prod/cfg/nightlyForCopier_i686-slc4-gcc34-opt.xml</rttcfg>
   <datasetDir>/castor/cern.ch/user/e/enzuobon</datasetDir>
   <stageArea>/afs/cern.ch/atlas/project/RTT/data/eric</stageArea>
</dsmcfg>

The mode tag in the copier config can take values: 
'active' and 'passive'
'passive' is meant to simulate the copying while 
'active' will actually do the copying

Running
=======

For the copier to copy data over the grid to a local disk,
the user needs to have a valid grid proxy. If you do not have 
a grid certificate, please look at the following sites which 
contain grid registration information.
http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/escience/gridintro.shtml
http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/users/registration/registration.html

To verify if your grid proxy is alive, do

grid-proxy-info

If no proxy is available, do 

grid-proxy-init

then enter password as requested.

If you have not checked out the RTT yet, check it out now

cmt co Tools/RunTimeTester 

will get you the head version

Set up the RTT so that you are able to run jobs. It is advisable to try
running some short jobs like HelloWorld to make sure RTT machinery is OK.

Now prepare a copier configuration file similar to the one shown above.

To launch the copier, cd to the directory where you downloaded the RTT 
and do

python Tools/RunTimeTester/dataCopier/copier_cern/src/DatasetManager.py  </my/copier/config/file>


The production cron table entry to run on nightlies are:
 /afs/cern.ch/atlas/project/RTT/prod/launch/runDataCopier_val.sh > /afs/cern.ch/user/r/rtt/copier_val.log
 /afs/cern.ch/atlas/project/RTT/prod/launch/runDataCopier_bugfix.sh >/afs/cern.ch/user/r/rtt/copier_bugfix.log
 /afs/cern.ch/atlas/project/RTT/prod/launch/runDataCopier.sh >/afs/cern.ch/user/r/rtt/copier.log


If all goes well, you see a screen similar to an RTT start-up screen.

When the process terminates, go the <reportDir> and examine the report.

Also verify new data were added to the catalog, if any were found.

If data were copied from the grid, verify that there were no broken copies in 
<datasetDir>/<dq2dataset>



Some sources of problems
 - invalid or no grid proxy ==> cannot download grid files
 - insufficient destination disk space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
CERN: the copier copies files available on the grid through grid  
commands. The destination is always castor.
No copies are performed for requests for files already on castor: the  
data copier only adds an entry to the catalogue with the same logical  
and physical name.

UCL: copies are performed for for files located on the grid, afs or  
castor. The destination is a local UCL disk.
