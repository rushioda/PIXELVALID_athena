package AtlasDoxygen

#------------------------------------------------------
#  All settings defined by this package should be selectively valued 
# only when the Doxygen tag is active
#
#  This tag is activated only when gmake doxygen is run. And this is actually
# triggered by the special target_xxx tag associated with the constituent.
#  The tag associated with the constistuent is named target_doxygen<package> just
# because the constituent has this name.
#  This specific tag is therefore associated with the generic Doxygen tag so as
# to have a generic format in this requirements
#
# Also the script Doxygen.sh actually used to drive doxygen makes use of the generic tag
# to perform additional queries.

# The DOXYGEN_HTML_MAPPING macro receives a space-separated list of address mappings each of the form:
#    <file-base>@<URL-base>
#
#  At generation time, all absolute paths used in outputs will be filtered and converted to URLs
#    (Relative paths don't need to be translated)
# This mechanism is generally useful when TAG-based mechanisms are active.
