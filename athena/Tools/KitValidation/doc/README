1. GENERAL INFORMATIONS

This suite is intended for users who want to validate an installation of the SIT
pacman distribution kit. Only atlas releases >= 7.5.0 are supported in this
validation suite.



2. HOW TO USE THE VALIDATION SUITE

Provided with the suite there is a script called "KitValidation". To start a
validation session you simply invoke this script. The syntax is

$> ./KitValidation [OPTIONS]

Please use the -h option to get the most updated list of possible options.

$> ./KitValidation -h
Usage: KitValidation [option]
       OPTIONS:
            --bw
                 Don't display colors
            -c|--compiler-path <path>
                 Specify the path of the compiler root directory
            -d|--data-path <path>
                 Force creating the output files in <path>/<subdir>
                 where <subdir> is created automatically
            -k|--keep-data
                 Do not delete the produced data/logfiles at the end
            --lcg|-L
                 Enable LCG specific features
            -p|--path <path>
                 Specify the path to the SITEROOT of the installation
            -r|--release <release version>
                 Specify the release version of the software to use
            -s|--scripts <path>
                 Specify the path to the scripts directory
            -v|--verbose
                 Be verbose
            -h|-help
                 Print this help

In general, if you want to start validating the Atlas release 7.5.0, installed
in /opt/atlas, you should type:

$> ./KitValidation -r 7.5.0 -p /opt/atlas

The validation suite will then perform all the predefined tests for that release
of the software and will report the final result.



3. HOW TO ADD A VALIDATION TEST

Several validation tests may be defined for each release.
The "KitValidation.conf" configuration file holds all the information about the
different test to be performed against the software releases. The syntax of the
configuration file is:

<version>:<script name>:[<test description>]

For example, if we need to perform the simple checks against the 7.6.0 release
of the distribution kit, we need to write

7.5.0:KitValidation-SimpleChecks-1.0.0-1:Release Simple Checks

The validation suite will execute the test in the order they are defined in the
configuration file, for each <version>.

Users may add other test simply adding a line in to the configuration
file and building a test script. For convenience a test script template,
called KitValidation-Template.trf, is provided in the suite. Please refer
to this template of to other predefined test scripts for other details.
