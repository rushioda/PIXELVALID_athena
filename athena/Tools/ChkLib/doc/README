 Athena might crash for several reasons. If it crashes with an error message
 complaining about a missing symbol you might check the symbols with ChkLib.
 If the same symbol is not shown as unresolved by the script it is probably
 a 'use' statement missing somewhere. If Athena crashes with a message like
 'blabla probably not built as a component library' it is more likely that 
 you will find the perpetrator with ChkLib.

 If you encounter a number of unresolved symbols in the InstallArea: Don't
 panic. Check if they belong to your package or if they belong to some other
 package of the atlas release. Normally the unresolved symbols from other
 packages can be ignored and are resolved when linking. This program just
 looks into the InstallArea and takes whatever .so files it can find. Not
 more. I do not know if it is worth going through LD_LIBRARY_PATH and to 
 check every library for the missing symbols. I have put the symbols which
 contains certain keywords into the 'Ignore-list' hardcoded into the 
 program. The existing setup works fine for me ...

 NOTE: Since the program uses the 'system' call I guess that there might
 be differences for different shells. I am using zsh, and it works.

 Comments and remarks are welcome. Have fun saving time hunting down 
 'not built as a component library' errors.

 TODO: - The use of map could be done for ignored and resolved symbols as
         well. 
       - Maybe I should introduce a switch if somebody wants to go
         through the whole LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
