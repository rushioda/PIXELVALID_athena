This document describes how to create plugins for the
athenaMT script framework.

1 - Create a script named plugin_pluginname;

2 - If it needs to allow the user to customize it.
    A rcathenaMT_pluginname must be present as a
    dot file in the user's home directory;

3 - The script should set the LD_PRELOAD environment
    variable just before performing the intended
    operation;

4 - The plugin must be available from the same directory
    as the athenaMT script.



Example:

If you wish to create a plugin called xpto, then the
script would be called plugin_xpto. And in case of
needing to read configuration options, the file would
be called .rcathenaMT_xpto.

Just look at the plugin_valgrid for a real example of
a plugin with all the options.
