         Simulation/Digitization
	------------------------

This package is a collection of scripts to run Digitization. It serves 
both DC2 and Rome production.
The main jobOptions is AtlasDigitization.py and a configuration script is 
provided in DigitizationConfig.py




Use of the Package:
-------------------
get_files PDGTABLE.MeV
get_files DigitizationConfig.py

Edit the file DigitizationConfig.py to set your options, and run it with:

athena DigitizationConfig.py Digitization/AtlasDigitization.py


Scripts to run Digitization:
-------------------------
Scripts to run simulation (transformations) are provided in the script 
directory for the Rome "configration". rome.g4digit.trf and 
rome.g4digit.MuonDigit.trf serve this purpose. The latter one 
provides a work around to avoid the creation of RDOs in the muon and save 
MuonDigits into the pool files. This is because RDO creation for the Muons 
does not work yet in 9.0.x.  LSF wrappers are also in the script 
directory

Note for Digitization of events with Muon layout Q:
--------------------------------------------------
This applies to Rome-Initial layout in release 9. 
Use the script rome.g4digit.MuonDigit.trf when digitizing events
with muon layout Q with all avaiable releases. Or add the following to 
DigitizationConfig.py:

DetDescrVersion = 'Rome-Initial'
#--------------------------------------------------------------
# Write Muon digits instead of RDOs
#--------------------------------------------------------------
writeMuonDigit = True
from AthenaCommon.DetFlags import DetFlags
DetFlags.writeRDOPool.Muon_setOff() 

Note for release 9.0.2
----------------------
Some packages need to be checked out: (they will go in 9.0.3)
cmt co Simulation/Digitization
The lines where the RomeRDBConfig.py files is created need to be uncommented

Note for release 9.0.3
----------------------
A file RomeIOVConfig.py is created and needs to be called right after the 
Digitization.py jobOptions. This sets the db table to InitLayout-A as required
to have the latest LAr conditions
