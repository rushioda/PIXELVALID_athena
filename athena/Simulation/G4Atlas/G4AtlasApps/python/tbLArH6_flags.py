""" Simulation specific flags.

 Apart from the AthenaCommon.DetFlags and AthenaCommon.GlobalFlags
 the simulation jobs will need specific flags that are collected
 here as "simFlags".

 The flags here described are for the the old standalone LAr
 test beams at the H6.

  Note: since revision version 1.10 the simFlags are using a new
 base class (JobProperty) that should add more functionality
