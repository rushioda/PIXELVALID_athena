<P>NICOS (NIghtly COntrol MANagement) facilitates nightly
builds of software projects. Nightly builds are common
in software project involving multiple developers.
NICOS is the system originally developed for ATLAS nightly
builds. It was evolved in the independent software package
that can be applied to more than one experiment or application.

<P>NICOS performs nightly build processes in distinctive steps.
Each step allows plug-ins and can be configured for 
particular use case. The compilation itself is one of initial 
steps followed by tests, analysis of errors, and creating
web pages with build summaries. Developers are notified about 
problems with their packages via e-mail. 

<P> NICOS supports the organization when the releases are built
on a local disk (usually fast and reliable) and then copied to 
a distributed file system (e.g. AFS). The builds can be incremental, i.e.
when only new versions of packages are compiled, or from scratch.
While NICOS is originally developed as the nightly build control system
it can also build stable and local "personal" releases (in latter case
the release contents is determined by a developer).

<P> NICOS allows to build the chain of nightly projects. In this case
the projects are built in the certain order determined by 
declared projects dependencies.

<P> NICOS core does not contain ATLAS specific features. 
For convenience of ATLAS software
infrastructure management the scripts with self-evident (and long) names for 
typical tasks are added to NICOS distribution.
These scripts require very few parameters and allow to run NICOS
without reading manuals.

<P><center> <B><A NAME="2">NICOS location</A></B> </center>
<P> The most recent version of NICOS is installed in<BR>
<CODE>/afs/cern.ch/atlas/software/dist/nightlies/nicos</CODE>.<BR>
ATLAS nightlies use this installation.
ATLAS software releases (and ATLAS CVS repository)
contain NICOS in <BR><code>AtlasTest/NightlyTestTools/Nicos</code>.<BR>
ATLAS plug-ins and extensions are collected in <CODE>atlas</CODE>
and the scripts for typical atlas tasks in
<CODE>atlasjobs</CODE> subdirectories.

<BR><BR>

<P><center> <B><A NAME="3">NICOS executable, environment, and files</A></B></CENTER>
<H6><A HREF="#0">BACK TO TOP</A></H6>
<P> NICOS executable is <CODE>nicos_job</CODE> (or similar name), a Bourne
shell script.  
Before running NICOS the following three variables must be defined:

<UL>
<LI> <CODE><B>NICOS_HOME</B></CODE> is the location of NICOS
installation (at CERN 
<CODE>/afs/cern.ch/atlas/software/dist/nightlies/nicos</CODE>)  

<LI> <CODE><B>NICOS_WORK_AREA</B></CODE> is an area for 
temporary NICOS files. It can be any empty directory
(if the directory does not exist then NICOS tries to
create it) 

<LI> <CODE><B>NICOS_CONFIG_AREA</B></CODE> is an area where
configuration files are located. For ATLAS nightly builds the 
configuration areas are located in:
<CODE>/afs/cern.ch/atlas/software/dist/nightlies/nicos_config_area&lt;suffix&gt;</CODE>
</UL> 

<P>    NICOS uses three configuration files (see descriptions
and examples below).

<UL> 

<LI><CODE>nicos_cache</CODE> (fixed name) 
must be located in <CODE>${NICOS_CONFIG_AREA}</CODE>.
It contains all definitions needed for nightly 
builds

<LI>NICOS tags database is a text file with names of packages, tags, 
and addresses of software developers. The name and location of this
file is defined in <CODE>nicos_cache</CODE>. In case of ATLAS nightly
builds NICOS runs a plug-in that retrieves the tags
from  <a href="http://tc2.in2p3.fr">ATLAS Tag Collector</a>. However the tags
in NICOS text file override the tags from Tag Collector

<LI>NICOS test database (optional) is a text file with names of tests,
test suites, locations in the software release,
and addresses of software developers. The name and location of this
file is defined in <CODE>nicos_cache</CODE>. In case of ATLAS nightly
builds NICOS uses <a href="http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/SOFTWARE/OO/dist/nightlies/nicoswww/atnight.html">ATN tool</a> that automatically finds in the release tree and 
runs integration tests. It reads the NICOS test database for information on
additional or canceled tests

</UL> 

<P>Once the above-mentioned variables are defined and nicos_cache
is configured the nicos job can be started with<BR>
<CODE>${NICOS_HOME}/nicos_job [OPTIONS]</CODE>
<P>The options are 
<UL>
<LI> <B> -b | --begin </B>: starting point of nicos_job; allowed values: all (full), build, tests, inttests, docs (documentation); default <b>full</b>
<LI> <B> -s | --scratch </B>: release area is cleaned before build. This option works only for full release builds
<LI> <B>  --copy </B>: repeat copy to the permanent release area
<LI> <B>  --nocopy </B>: cancel copy to the permanent release area. This option works when the release is build in a local area and then copied to a distributed file system
<LI> <B> --nowait </B>: when building the chain of projects: do not wait for completion of projects that current project uses 
<LI> <B> -r | --relnum </B>: release number (not name, just a number in the end of name, e.g. "5"). It overrides automatically generated number
<LI> <B> -h | --help </B>: show help 
</UL>

<P><CENTER><B><A NAME="4">NICOS configuration file</A></B></CENTER>
<H6><A HREF="#0">BACK TO TOP</A></H6>
<P> This file in XML-like format contains all necessary 
configuration parameters. Each build step is associated 
with Markup tag that is followed by environment definitions
and commands for particular step. Markup tag can contain 
some name or base directory definitions. Below are the examples
from ATLAS nightly builds configuration files with commentaries.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> INITIALIZATION STEP: PROJECT SETTINGS. At this step general environment variables
are defined (valid for all other steps). 
ATLAS has several nightly projects (~ 20 as of December 2005)
with similar configuration. The "common" parameters can be specified
in shared configuration file (its name should be declared in
<CODE>NICOS_COMMON_CONFIG_AREA</CODE> variable). If a shared configuration is
specified then NICOS  
<OL>
<LI> set environment specified in the project configuration file
<LI> set environment specified in the shared configuration file. Hence the 
shared configuration file can use variables from the project configuration file
<LI> reset environment according the project configuration. Therefore the 
definitions of project configuration file are dominant.
</OL> 

<PRE>
&lt;PROJECT SETTING name=ABCD relname=atlrel lifetime=2 sf=SlcOpt inc=yes&gt;
NICOS_PROJECT_HOME=/build/atnight/localbuilds/nightlies/rel
</PRE>
In Markup tag several names are defined:
<OL>
<LI> name of project. This name is used for reference purposes
on generated web pages only
<LI> name of directories with nightly releases (<CODE>atlrel</CODE>).
The suffix with the release number is appended, for instance for
seven day cycle the releases names are <CODE>atlrel_0</CODE> -
<CODE>atlrel_6</CODE>, where the number is a day of week
<LI> <CODE>lifetime</CODE> indicates number of releases in a cycle
(1 - 365). For instance, if it is equal to 7 then
seven nightly releases exist ( "0" release is built
on Sunday, "1" is built by Tuesday etc. )
<LI> <CODE>sf</CODE> is a suffix added to the names of standard
NICOS areas. This is useful when several nightlies share one
code (e.g. optimized and debug ATLAS builds), so their log files
areas get different suffixes. Stored in variable $NICOS_SUFFIX
<LI> <CODE>inc</CODE> indicates that the builds are incremental
(i.e. use the results of previous nightlies)
</OL>

<P> The tag content example:

<PRE>
NICOS_PROJECT_HOME=/build/atnight/localbuilds/nightlies/rel

# Area for NICOS time stamps used for synchronization of dependent projects
NICOS_BUILD_FROM_SCRATCH="yes"
# All files are wiped out from the release area before the build if "yes",
# The sources are updated and release area is not cleaned if "no"
NICOS_ATLAS_RELEASE="11.1.0"
# This variable is added for convenience (not genuine NICOS variable)
NICOS_TITLE_COMMENT="tags for ${NICOS_ATLAS_RELEASE}" 
# This line is added in the title of NICOS web pages
NICOS_HOUR=15
# This variable indicates that the builds started after 15:00 
# get release name with the suffix for the next day. For example
# if release starts on Monday at 21:00 then its name gets suffix _2

#Variables for CMT setup.
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 1: RELEASE TOOL SETUP. At this step the release
tool is initialized. The NICOS database file is generated
by the external script that connects to Tag Collector. 
The commands inside <BYPASS> tag are not run for partial builds
procedures (e.g. when only tests are repeated). In Markup tag the
work directory (relative to the release directory $NICOS_RELHOME) is defined.
If <CODE>command=source</CODE> is indicated then the variables
defined at this step are valid for subsequent steps.  
<PRE>
&lt;RELEASE TOOL SETUP dir=. command=source&gt;
source ${CMTROOT}/mgr/setup.sh
CMTPATH=${NICOS_RELHOME}
<BYPASS>
if [ "$NICOS_PROJECT_TYPE" != "parallel" ]; then
${NICOS_HOME}/atlas/atlas_read_tagcollector ${NICOS_ATLAS_RELEASE}
rm -rf ${NICOS_RELHOME}/InstallArea
fi
</BYPASS>
</pre>

<LI> STEP 2: CHECKOUT. At this step the sources are
checked out.
In Markup tag the following is defined:
<OL>
<LI> method of tag storage; for ATLAS use case it is <CODE>file</CODE>
that is text database file.
<LI> directory in which sources are stored in CVS repository
(could be ".").
<LI> command for checkout, if different from <CODE>cvs</CODE>.
<LI> shell for checkout commands. The access to ATLAS CVS repository
requires TGT kerberos token that can be obtained in
<CODE>pagsh</CODE>.
</OL>

<PRE>
&lt;CHECKOUT tagstorage=file cvsdir=offline command=cmt shell=/usr/bin/pagsh.krb&gt;
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 3: PROJECT SETUP. At this step additional
commands for project setup can be performed. In this
example the external scripts generate cmt/requirements
file for AtlasRelease package and setup CMT.
In Markup tag the
work directory (relative to the release directory $NICOS_RELHOME) is defined.
If <CODE>command=source</CODE> is indicated then the variables
defined at this step are valid for subsequent steps.
<PRE>
&lt;PROJECT SETUP dir=. command=source&gt;
<BYPASS>
if [ "$NICOS_PROJECT_TYPE" != "parallel" ]; then
cd $NICOS_RELHOME/AtlasRelease/*/cmt
${NICOS_HOME}/atlas/atlas_generate_req
cd ${NICOS_PROJECT_HOME}/${NICOS_PROJECTSETUP_DIR}
</BYPASS>
source ${NICOS_HOME}/atlas/setup_cmt.sh
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 4: PROJECT BUILD: Commands for
release build are listed (example from ATLAS nightlies). NICOS needs 
<CODE>NICOS_BUILDLOG_SEPARATOR</CODE> be defined.
It is required that the release build tool prints
a separating line between builds of different packages.
This line should contain the name of package to be
built (preferably with all containers,
for instance <CODE>Utilities/FileCatalog</CODE>
if package FileCatalog is in the container Utilities).
In Markup tag the work directory (relative to the release directory 
$NICOS_RELHOME) is defined. Also the desirable shell
can be indicated.

<PRE>
&lt;PROJECT BUILD dir=AtlasRelease/*/cmt shell=/bin/zsh&gt;
cmt broadcast - 'rm -f ../i686*/*.so ; rm -rf ../run'
cmt broadcast - cmt config
source setup.sh
cmt broadcast - make
NICOS_FULLNAME_INSEPARATOR="yes"
NICOS_BUILDLOG_SEPARATOR="Now trying"
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 4': COPY AFTER BUILD: Optional tag for copy to
a distributed file system. The copy is performed with
<CODE>rsync</CODE>. In the Markup tag the
work directory (relative to the release directory $NICOS_RELHOME),
desirable shell and copy type is defined. The possible
copy types are:
<OL>
<LI><B>scratch</B> - the target area is cleaned prior the copy start
<LI><B>update</B> - the target area is not cleaned prior the copy start. 
This option is useful when the target area already contains the 
previous nightly release and the changes in the new release are small.
<LI><B>merge</B> - the binaries of another platform are added. This job
must be performed by an external script or command in the tag content. 
</OL>

<PRE>
&lt;COPY AFTER BUILD dir=AtlasRelease/*/cmt shell=/bin/sh type=scratch&gt;   
#the additional commands can be added in the content, for example,
#for fixing soft links in the copied release (as rsync does not
#modify soft links automatically).
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 5: QA TESTS: Command for unit tests are listed. 
<PRE>
&lt;QA TESTS dir=AtlasRelease/*/cmt&gt;
cp -a ${NICOS_RELHOME}/Tools/Scripts/Scripts-*/share/checkreq.sh ~/.
cmt broadcast - ~/checkreq.sh
NICOS_FULLNAME_INSEPARATOR="yes"
NICOS_BUILDLOG_SEPARATOR="Now trying"
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 6: UNIT TESTS: Command for unit tests are listed. Currently This
step is not used.
<PRE>
&lt;UNIT TESTS dir=.&gt;
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 7: INTEGRATED TESTS: Commands for the ATN testing tool are listed.
<PRE>
&lt;INTEGRATED TESTS dir=qmtest tool=qmtest> &gt;
ATN_HOME=/afs/cern.ch/atlas/software/dist/nightlies/atn_11
NICOS_INTTESTS_FILES=".sh$"
NICOS_INTTESTS_LOCATION="AtlasTest/TestTools/*/scripts/nightlies"
NIGHTLYAREA=${NICOS_RELHOME}
cd $NICOS_RELHOME/AtlasRelease/*/cmt
source setup.sh
</PRE>
In Markup tag directory is defined from which this step is performed.
If tool is <CODE>qmtest</CODE> then the Python based QMTest tool
is used for running tests.

<LI> STEP 7': COPY AFTER TESTS: Optional tag for copy to
a distributed file system. The copy is performed with
<CODE>rsync</CODE>. In the Markup tag the
work directory (relative to the release directory $NICOS_RELHOME),
desirable shell and copy type is defined. If the copy after 
build is performed then the recommended type is <CODE>"update"</CODE>.

<PRE>
&lt;COPY AFTER TESTS dir=AtlasRelease/*/cmt shell=/bin/sh type=update&gt;
#the additional commands can be added in the content, for example,
#for fixing soft links in the copied release (as rsync does not
#modify soft links automatically).
</PRE>

<LI> STEP 8: ERROR ANALYSIS: The following options should be 
specified.
<OL>
<LI> <CODE>NICOS_TEST_SUCCESS_PATTERN</CODE>: this pattern
must be present in output of successful integration test.
<LI> <CODE>NICOS_TEST_FAILURE_PATTERN</CODE>: this pattern
must be absent in output of successful integration test.
<LI> <CODE>NICOS_TEST_WARNING_PATTERN</CODE>: this pattern
triggers warning level of alarm
<LI> Similar patterns can be indicated for QA checks
<LI> <CODE>NICOS_MAIL</CODE>: if "yes" then automatic e-mail 
notifications about problems are sent (to addresses from 
NICOS database file). 
</OL>
<PRE>
&lt;ERROR ANALYSIS&gt;
NICOS_TEST_SUCCESS_PATTERN=" "
NICOS_TEST_FAILURE_PATTERN="FAILURE "
NICOS_TEST_WARNING_PATTERN="test warning"
NICOS_QA_SUCCESS_PATTERN=" "
NICOS_QA_FAILURE_PATTERN="FAILURE "
NICOS_QA_WARNING_PATTERN="checkreq warning"
NICOS_MAIL="no"
NICOS_MAIL_UNIT_TESTS="no"
NICOS_MAIL_QA_TESTS="no"

</PRE>

<LI> STEP 9: WEB PAGE. This step at which web pages with build
summaries are generated does not require additional commands
or definitions.
<PRE>
&lt;WEB PAGE&gt;
</PRE>

</UL>

<P><CENTER><B><A NAME="5">NICOS database file</A></B></CENTER>
<H6><A HREF="#0">BACK TO TOP</A></H6>
<P> NICOS database file is a text file. Each line contains
name of package, tag of package, and e-mail addresses of developers
(could be multiple) separated by unlimited number of spaces.
For example:

<PRE>
FileCatalog    FileCatalog-0-0-1   developer1@cern.ch developer2@bnl.gov
Utilities/FileCatalog    Utilites-0-0-1   developer1@cern.ch 
</PRE>

Note that the second line describes a package inside container,
so checkout is performed for <CODE>Utilities/FileCatalog</CODE>.

<P> There are several options for tags:
<P><OL>
<LI> Exact tag or the first symbols of the tag. In latter case
the latest tag with indicated symbols will be selected.
For instance if <CODE>FileCatalog</CODE> is specified as a tag
then the latest tag with name starting with <CODE>FileCatalog</CODE>
will be selected (e.g. <CODE>FileCatalog-89-99-99</CODE>).    
<LI> <CODE>recent</CODE> : the recent CVS submission is selected
(not necessarily tagged).
<LI><code>development</code> : the latest tagged CVS version is
selected, the format of tag name is not restricted.
<LI> <code> official </code> : the latest tag in the format
<code>&lt;package name&gt;-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]</code> or
<code>&lt;package name&gt;-[0-9]-[0-9]-[0-9]</code>
is selected.
