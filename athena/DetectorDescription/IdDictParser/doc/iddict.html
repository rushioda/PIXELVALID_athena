<h2>1. - Overview</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>

The software notes: ATL-SOFT-2001-004 and ATL-MUON-2001-014 describe
the offline identifier scheme for the various detectors, where the
latter note is just for the muons. The identifiers are hierarchically
structured following a logical decomposition of the ATLAS
detector. For example, the top level specifies the detector system
(InnerDetector, LArCalorimeter, TileCalorimeter, MuonSpectrometer) and
the next level down typically specifies the detector subsystem (pixel,
sct, etc.). Subsequently there may be a level which distinguishes
between barrel or endcap, or a level which specifies which layer or
defines the eta/phi numbering within a layer. The muon system scheme
is somewhat different in that they first identify the stations of the
muon system and then the different detector technology within each
station.

</p>

<p>

This scheme is currently being used to identify individual readout
channels and as well corresponding "detector elements", where a
detector element is a higher level grouping of a number of readout
channels. For example, the silicon wafers server as "detector
elements" for the pixels and SCT.

</p>

<p>

The readout and detector element identifiers are being used in a
variety of ways. For example, the High Level Trigger is accessing data
limited to regions of interest by geometrical eta/phi regions into
lists of detector element identifiers which specify which bytestream
data to decode and make available. Another important use is to connect
the readout data its their corresponding detector description
information, for example, to calculate positions or energies.

</p>

<p></p>

The software infrastructure to support this work can be split into three
parts:

<ul>
  <li> Specification of the identifier structure
  <li> Creation and interpretation of the identifiers
  <li> The identifier classes themselves
</ul>


<p></p>
<a name="Identifier-structure"></a>
<h3>Identifier structure</h3>
<blockquote>

<p>

The identifier specification is captured by an "identifier dictionary"
which is in the IdDict package. The values allowed for the identifiers
of each subsystem can be expressed in terms of a set of "regions"
where for each region one provides the allowed values for each of the
levels. For example, for the pixel detector, the channel numbering on
each wafer is the same.  The number of wafers varies in each layer in
the barrel, but the endcap disks are all similar. Thus, one is able to
describe the pixel identifier numbering with only four regions: one
for each of the three layers in the barrel and one for the endcaps.

</p>

<p>

Today, the region description is specified in XML (eXtended Markup
Language) in an ASCII file.  The dictionary reads the XML descriptions
and maintains them in memory. There is a dictionary manager
(IdDictMgr) which holds a dictionary for each detector system
(InnerDetector, LArCalorimeter, TileCalorimeter, MuonSpectrometer).
Each dictionary provides three primary functions:

</p>

<ul>

  <li> Access to its "fields", where each level in the identifier
  hierarchy corresponds to a single field. Thus, a client who "knows"
  the names of the different levels in of identifier may get their
  index or level number.

  <li> Access to the allowed values for the identifiers of a
  particular subsystem (or region). The allowed values are captured by
  a MultiRange object, discussed in more detail in section
  (<a href="#range">2. Range and MultiRange classes</a>). The allowed
  values may correspond to the full identifiers down to the readout
  channel level, or one may request the allowed values for a limited
  number of levels, for example just for the detector elements.

  <li> Packing and unpacking of compact identifiers. The MultiRange
  objects provide identifiers in an expanded form. It is the
  dictionary that "knows" how to compactify them. 

</ul>

</blockquote>

<p></p>
<a name="Identifier-creation"></a>
<h3>Identifier creation and interpretation</h3>
<blockquote>

There are helper classes for each detector subsystem which interact
with the identifier dictionary to allow creation of the required
identifiers as well as their corresponding interpretation (see <a
href="#helper">IdHelper classes and tests</a>). For the InnerDetector,
these classes are PixelID, SCT_ID and TRT_ID which reside in the
InDetIdentifier package. These classes are used to create Identifier
objects, for example, when constructing a digit or a readout object by
providing the helper class with the set of indices for the various
levels of the identifier. One also uses the helper classes to extract
from an Identifier object the information as to whether it belongs to
the barrel or endcap, its layer number, etc.

<p>

The helpers are intialized from the information in the
dictionary. They are stored in the Athena Detector Store and are
accessed via the detector description managers for each system. They
provide the interface to manipulate identifiers for the rest of the
software, e.g. Athena algorithms.  

</blockquote>

<p></p>
<a name="Identifier-classes"></a>
<h3>Identifier classes</h3>
<blockquote>

There are three different identifier classes used in the software
(which can be found in the Identifier package below
DetectorDescription):

<ul>
  <li> Identifier - compact 32-bit identifier
  <li> IdentifierHash - compact 32-bit identifier which can be used a
  a compact hash code for direct access
  <li> ExpandedIdentifier - an identifier whose fields are
  "expanded", for example, into an internal vector, providing
  fast access to the value of any field.
</ul>

<p>

The first two forms, Identifier and IdentifierHash, are the objects
which are widely used in the software to provide the identification of
readout channels and detector elements.  The expanded form is
primarily used by the helper classes and the dictionary.

</p>

<p>

The Identifier class contains the id values of the different levels
packed into a 32-bit word. For a given subsystem, one may obtain
different Identifier objects depending upon the number of levels
included.  For example for the pixels, an Identifier which identifies
"detector elements" includes levels from "InnerDetector" down to "eta
module" which corresponds to the individual wafers. Similarly for the
muons, one can identify stations, MDT multilayers or layers or tubes
all with different sets of Identifier objects. For any set of objects,
e.g. a set up rpc readout strips, the identifiers can be used as a
search key with corresponding log(N) lookup time. The interface of the
Identifier class is quite simple. Its primary method is just the
comparison operator (operator <) so that it behaves as a "type-safe
unsigned int".

</p>

<p>

The IdentifierHash class is similar the Identifier class - it
basically is a "type-safe unsigned int".  However, it is used to
distinguish the special where the total number N of a set of objects
is known. In this case, one is able to transform a packed Identifier
into a "hash" code with a value from 0 to N-1, and thus perform
constant-time lookup, for example in a simple vector.  In general,
hash tables provide constant-time lookup, however, one must trade-off
the cost of converting a key into a hash code and allow for clashes
(where two different keys may convert into the same hash code and must
be treated specially). For our situation, it is the "detector
elements" which in general will be identified with
IdentifierHash. This allows a fast lookup, for example, when using
IdentifiableContainer to collect raw data objects within regons of
interest, or when fetching the transformation matrices for the
detector elements from the detector store.

<a name="IdDict-specif"></a>
<h2>2 - IdDict dictionary specification</h2>
<blockquote>

<p>

The identifier dictionary describes the possible identifier
ranges. One may describe several identifier dictionaries. Currently
there is one dictionary for the top identifier level and one for each
detector system.

</p>

A dictionary is identified by its name and may contain the follow
three elements:

<ul>
  <li> <strong>individual identifier fields ("field") </strong>. A field
  corresponds to a single level in an identifier specification. For
  example, the InnerDetector defines the field "part" for the
  subsystems Pixel, SCT and TRT: </li>

<pre>  &lt;field name="part"&gt;
    &lt;label name="Pixel" value="1" /&gt;
    &lt;label name="SCT"   value="2" /&gt;
    &lt;label name="TRT"   value="3" /&gt;
  &lt;/field&gt;</pre>  
  
  <ul>

    <li>The list of "labels" are the possible field values in terms of 
    character strings and their corresponding numerical values. </li>

    <li>This "field specification" should only be used when the field
    values are individually labelled with names.</li>

    <li>Purely numerical fields do not need to be explicitly described
    as a field.  In this case, the possible ranges are deduced from
    the defined regions (see next).</li>

  </ul>

  <li><a name="idregion"></a><strong>identifier regions
  ("region")</strong>. A region specifies a contiguous range of
  identifiers, where different regions should not overlap. For example,
  for layer 0 of the pixel barrel is defined as</li>

<pre>  &lt;region&gt;
    &lt;reference subregion="pixel_barrel" /&gt;
    &lt;range field="layer" value="0" /&gt;
    &lt;range field="phi_module" minvalue="0" maxvalue="21" wraparound="TRUE" /&gt;
    &lt;range field="eta_module" minvalue="-6" maxvalue="+6" /&gt;
    &lt;range field="phi_index" minvalue="0" maxvalue="327" /&gt;
    &lt;range field="eta_index" minvalue="0" maxvalue="191" /&gt;
  &lt;/region&gt;</pre>  

  
  <ul>
    <li>a region may be labelled with a "name" (not shown)</li>
    <li>a region contains the ordered list of fields with their
    explicit value range, where the order defines the identifier level
    structure</li>
    <li>each entry in this list may be</li>
    <ul>
      <li>a range assigned to a given field ("range"). A range can be specified as:
      <ul>
	<li>single value</li>
	<li>min/max values</li>
	<li>a space-separated list of values</li>
      </ul>
      Note that a range may be specified to "wraparound" as is often
      the case of the phi coordinate.</li>
      <li>a reference to a subregion (see below)</li>
      <li>a reference to a separate identifier dictionary, for example 

<pre>  &lt;region&gt;
    &lt;range field="subdet" value="InnerDetector" /&gt;
    &lt;dictionary name="InnerDetector" /&gt;
  &lt;/region&gt;</pre>

      defines the top level of the InnerDetector identifiers with the
      rest defined in the InnerDetector dictionary</li>
      
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <li><strong>subregions ("subregion")</strong>. A subregion specifies
  a subset of a region and is useful when a subregion is the same for a
  number of region specifications in a dictionary. For example, the
  subregion "pixel_barrel" of the above example is defined as: </li>

<pre>  &lt;subregion name="pixel_barrel"&gt;
    &lt;range field="part" value="Pixel" /&gt;
    &lt;range field="barrel_endcap" value="barrel" /&gt;
  &lt;/subregion&gt;</pre>

  A subregion must be identified by a name.
  
</ul>

</p>

<a name="range"></a>
<h2>3 - Range and MultiRange classes</h2>
<blockquote>

A Range class corresponds to the region specification of the
dictionary (see <a href="#idregion">idDict region</a>).  This
effectively captures the a range of values for each of the identifier
levels for a region or subset of identifiers. The Range class
interacts with the ExpandedIdentifier class. This class can be found
in the Identifier package under DetectorDescription. The Range
interface provides:

<ul>
  <li>a <em>match</em> method which can be used to check whether an
  ExpandedIdentifier is "valid", i.e. within the specification
  captured in a range object.</li>
  <li><em>iterators</em> to be able to iterate over all ExpandedIdentifiers
  within the range</li>
  <li>a <em>cardinality</em> method which provides the number of
  identifiers within the range</li>
  <li>a <em>show</em> method with prints to std::cout the range values</li>
  <li>an embedded <em>field</em> class to examine the fields/levels of
  the range. The fields are accessed with <em>operator []</em></li>
  <li><em>minumum</em> and <em>maximum</em> methods for the bounding
  Identifiers of a range </li>
</ul>

The MultiRange class is simply a "container" class for more than one
Range. It is a MultiRange that can represent a full Identifier
specification for the identifiers of a subsystem.

<a name="helper"></a>
<h2>4 - IdHelper classes and tests</h2>
<blockquote>

<p> For each detector system there are separate helper classes for
each subsystem which allow creation and interpretation of the various
kinds of identifiers. These classes are the "servers" for any client
who needs to know more about an identifier than simply using it as a
lookup key. These classes "pre-digest" the information in the
identifier dictionary.  We provide here some of the details of the
helper classes developed for the InnerDetector to allow other helper
classes to be developed.  </p>

<h3>4.1 - IdDictTest algorithm</h3>

<p> There is a test algorithm IdDictTest under AtlasTest/DetDescrTest
which serves as an overall test of the idhelpers. For the inner
detector, tests are performed by comparing detector element
identifiers which are obtained from the detector description manager
(derived from the geant 3 information) with the detector elements
identifiers provided by the helpers.  This check assures that the
sets of identifiers are identical and has been used to correct the XML
specification which is the source for the idhelpers.</p>


<h3>4.2 - PixelID example</h3>

<p>We take as an example the PixelID class which is the helper class
for the Pixel ids (in package InDetIdentifier under
InnerDetector/InDetDetDescr).  </p>


<ul>
  <li><strong>Creating Identifier objects</strong> This class
  constucts Identifier objects for wafers and individual pixels given
  the correct set of indices:

<pre>    // For a single crystal
    Identifier  wafer_id ( int barrel_ec,  
			   int layer_disk, 
			   int phi_module, 
			   int eta_module ) const;

    // For an individual pixel
    Identifier  pixel_id ( int barrel_ec,  
			   int layer_disk, 
			   int phi_module, 
			   int eta_module, 
			   int phi_index,  
			   int eta_index) const;
    Identifier  pixel_id ( const Identifier& id, 
			   int phi_index,   
			   int eta_index) const;</pre>
  </li>
<p></p> 
  <li><strong>Id conversion </strong>Conversion between the types of identifiers is given by:

<pre>    //
    // access to IdContext's which define which levels or fields are
    // contained in the Pixel id
    //
    // id for wafer
    IdContext   wafer_context           (void) const;
    // id for pixels
    IdContext   pixel_context           (void) const;


    // Create compact id from hash id (return == 0 for OK)
    virtual int         get_id          (const IdentifierHash& hash_id,
                                         Identifier& id,
                                         const IdContext* context = 0) const;
    
    // Create hash id from compact id (return == 0 for OK)
    virtual int         get_hash        (const Identifier& id, 
                                         IdentifierHash& hash_id,
                                         const IdContext* context = 0) const;

    // Create Identifier from expanded id, which is returned by the
    // id_iterators
    int                 get_id          (const ExpandedIdentifier& old_id,
                                         Identifier& new_id) const;</pre>

Note that the IdContext objects contain the information on how
many levels are included in an Identifier. This is needed because the
identifiers themselves do not know how "long" they are (only an
ExpandedIdentifier does). For example, a wafer id is missing the
eta_channel and phi_channel fields of a pixel id, that is they are
just set to 0. So when converting an Identifier to an IdentifierHash
and vice-versus one must provide the IdContext.
</li>
<p></p>
  <li><strong>Helper initialization</strong> Initialization of the helper is done with the method:
<pre>    // Initialization from the identifier dictionary
    virtual int         initialize_from_dictionary(const IdDictMgr& dict_mgr);</pre>

Note that the IdHelpers are initialized with an IdDictMgr which is
a manager that holds all of the identifier dictionaries - one for each
detector system. This manager is obtain from the DetectorStore. See
the InDetMgrDetDescrCnv::initIds method in the InDetMgrDetDescrCnv
package under InnerDetector/InDetDetDescrCnv as an example.
<br>
The initialization itself procedures along the following steps:
<ul>
  <li>Query the dictionary to find out the index number of each field
  or level. Here the idhelper "knows" only the <em>name</em> of each
  level and asks the dictionary for its index. </li>
  <li>The PixelID initializes two MultiRange objects - one for the
  wafer ids and one for the pixel ids. For this one uses the following
  methods of the class IdDictDictionary:

<pre>  MultiRange build_multirange () const; 
    /**
     *   Get MultiRange for a specific region_id up to and including
     *   'last_field' If last_field == "", all fields are
     *   taken. Prepend prefix if provided.
     */
  MultiRange build_multirange (const ExpandedIdentifier& region_id,
			       const Range prefix = Range(),
			       const std::string last_field = "") const; </pre>

  where the former creates a multirange for all levels, i.e. for the
  pixel id multirange, and the latter allows one to extract a
  multirange for just a subset of the levels, i.e. for the wafer
  multirange. </li>

  <li>With the multiranges in hand, one can initialize a vector of
  IdentifierHashes. The easiest way to do this is to just create a
  vector of Identifier objects. Then to get a hash given an
  Identifier, one simple does a binary search for the Identifier in
  the vector and creates an IdentifierHash from the vector index of
  Identifier found.</li>

  <li>Other sorts of initialization can be done at this step which may
  help to provide further functionality. For example, to provide fast
  access to detector elements which are adjacent neighbours in eta or
  phi, one may want to set up tables which can be used by the
  IdentifierHashes to get the IdentifierHash of each neighbour +/-1 in
  eta or phi. </li>
  
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Other methods</strong> Other useful methods are hash
maximum sizes and iterators over the full range of identifiers:

<pre>    //
    // Hash table maximum sizes
    //
    size_type   wafer_hash_max          (void) const;
    size_type   pixel_hash_max          (void) const;

    //
    // Iterators over full set of ids. Wafer iterator is sorted
    //
    const_id_iterator   wafer_begin                     (void) const;
    const_id_iterator   wafer_end                       (void) const;
    // For pixel ids, only expanded id iterators are available. Use
    // following "get_id) method to obtain a compact identifier
    const_expanded_id_iterator  pixel_begin             (void) const;  
    const_expanded_id_iterator  pixel_end               (void) const;</pre>
</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Decoding Identifiers</strong> Finally, methods are needed
to extract the individual fields from an Identifier, for example:

<pre>    // Test for barrel
    bool	is_barrel	(const Identifier& id) const;  

    // Values of different levels
    int         barrel_ec       (const Identifier& id) const;  
    int         layer_disk      (const Identifier& id) const; 
    int         phi_module      (const Identifier& id) const; 
    int         eta_module     	(const Identifier& id) const; 
    int         phi_index       (const Identifier& id) const;
    int         eta_index       (const Identifier& id) const;</pre>

</li>
</ul>
