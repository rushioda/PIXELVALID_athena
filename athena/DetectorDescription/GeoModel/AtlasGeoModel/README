General Usage notes.
===================

To initialize the geometry simply put in your joboptions:

 DetDescrVersion = "DC2"  # or "Rome-Initial" or "CTB"
 include( "AtlasGeoModel/SetGeometryVersion.py" )
 include( "AtlasGeoModel/GeoModelInit.py" )

There are other possibilities for the values of DetDescrVersion.
See SetGeometryVersion.py to see full list of values that the 
DetDescrVersion variable can have.

You can turn off detectors using DetFlags. The scripts also look at GlobalFlags
to determine if it is CTB or DC1 geometries which require special
treatment (they still have NOVA dependencies and CTB uses different libraries) 
As long as these flags are set correctly the correct geometry should be
loaded.

======================================================

GeoModelInit.py		        Initializes GeoModel. Loads GeoModelSvc.
                                Also Nova for DC1 and CTB geometries.

SetGeometryVersion.py           Sets the appropriate Geometry tags based
                                on the variable DetDescrVersion. In the
                                future this will not be needed for
                                reconstruction as the geometry version will
                                be determined from the POOL file or CondDB.
                                The script also sets a few other items not
                                yet controlled by the database, but these
                                are in the process of being put in the database.


The following job options are used by the above. Users do not need to call
them directly. Users can turn off detectors using DetFlags.
                                
GeoModelInitStandard.py         Standard initialization.
GeoModelInitDC1.py              Initialization for DC1.
GeoModelInitCTB.py              Initialization fro CTB.
