    /// This is a specialized mechanism pioneered for the e/gamma and
    /// muon scale factors.  Instead of evaluating a large number of
    /// systematics separately, it allows to vary all of them at the
    /// same time repeatedly, so that instead of hundreds of
    /// systematic variations you only have to perform maybe 10 or 20
    /// "toy" variations.  You then just take the spread of the
    /// variations as the overall systematic uncertainty from the
    /// toys.  There are reports that compared to the "old" method
    /// this can yield a factor five reduction in systematic
    /// uncertainty without increasing the number of systematic
    /// variations to evaluate.
    ///
    /// Please note that this approach requires a more expert handling
    /// than "regular" systematics.  The main point here is that the
    /// "toy" variations need a different post-processing than regular
    /// variations, i.e. you need to look at the spread between the
    /// output histograms for the different "toys" and use that to
    /// construct the combined systematic.  The e/gamma group
    /// currently (Oct 15) provides a tool for that.  For Bayesian
    /// marginalization you may alternatively consider to integrate
    /// the "toy" variations directly into the integral over nuisance
    /// parameter space to extract more information than you could
    /// with a single systematic.
    ///
    /// A general concern for all methods that reduce the number of
    /// nuisance parameters (including the "toy" approach) is if you
    /// use profiling and are able to constrain the "toy" systematic,
    /// in which case we generally assume that such an approach is
    /// invalid.  Similar precautions should be taken when used with
    /// Bayesian marginalization.  This is typically of little
    /// practical concern as long as the systematic in question is
    /// small, but it is something that you should check for and that
    /// you should include in your supporting documentation.
    ///
    /// The "toy" approach to systematics evaluation introduces an
    /// additional statistical jitter into your systematics, due to
    /// the sampling fluctuations of your "toy" variations.  Naturally
    /// this uncertainty decreases if you use a larger number of "toy"
    /// variations.  We currently (Oct 15) provide no recommendations
    /// for evaluating the size of that uncertainty or for determining
    /// whether your chosen number of "toys" is sufficient.  Anecdotal
    /// evidence from the e/gamma group suggests that for evaluating
    /// their scale factor systematic as little as 10 or 20 "toys" may
    /// be sufficient.  However, this will vary depending on your
    /// analysis and the systematics you use the "toys" for.
    ///
    /// If you decide to go for a large number of "toy" variations it
    /// may be better to go for a "traditional" evaluation of your
    /// systematics instead, as that can cut down on the
    /// aforementioned statistical jitter by interpolating between the
    /// variations.  The number of variations needed for the
    /// traditional approach to be better (or even feasible) will
    /// depend on the interpolation algorithm used and is likely to
    /// improve as we implement better interpolation algorithms.
