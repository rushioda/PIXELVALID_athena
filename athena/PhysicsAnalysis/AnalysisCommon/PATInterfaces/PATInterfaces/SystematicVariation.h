// This module implements a class that manages the various
// representations of a single systematic variation.  The interface
// provided in this module is intended for the general user.  The
// module is considered to be in the pre-alpha stage.

// The current implementation isn't particularly efficient, in fact it
// is terribly inefficient, as most of the accessors involve a lot of
// string operations.  However, the current accessors should allow for
// more efficient implementations if needed.  And this class is likely
// only to be used during job startup, meaning an inefficient
// implementation is likely to have little to no effect on overall job
// execution time.  At the same time objects of this type are likely
// to be kept around for the entire runtime of the job, meaning the
// current small memory footprint should have advantages.
