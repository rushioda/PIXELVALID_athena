/**
 * @brief Common object getter code for retrieving from StoreGate.
 *
 * This class fulfills part of the @c IObjGetterTool interface,
 * fetching an object from StoreGate.  It's structured as a mixin
 * class, so it can be used both for single-object and container
 * getter tools.
 *
 * This class uses a few properties, but since it's a mixin (and doesn't
 * derive from @c AlgTool) it can't declare the properties itself.
 * Instead, it defines the macro @c SGGETTERIMPL_PROPS, which should
 * be used in the constructor of the derived @c AlgTool class.
 * You should also call @c initializeImpl() from @c initialize().
 *
 * The object being retrieved is specified by the properties
 * @c TypeName and @c SGKey.  SGKey may be a comma or space-separated list;
 * the first entry that's actually present in the event store will be used.
 * In addition, the property @c ClassIDSvc
 * may be used to specify the instance of this service.
