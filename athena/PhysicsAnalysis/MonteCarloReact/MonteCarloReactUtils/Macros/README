How to create an .mcr file:

1. Check out and compile MonteCarloReactUtils

2. Go to MonteCarloReactUtils/Macros/ and create a link to MonteCarloReactUtils/MonteCarloReactUtils/

> ln -s ../../MonteCarloReactUtils/MonteCarloReactUtils/ MonteCarloReactUtils

3. Compile MakeEff.cpp:

> gmake

These is just a very first test which is probalby not platform independent. It should work at CERN
on sl4 machines. If you are on a sl3 machine it might be possible that one has to change the
../../../../InstallArea/i686-slc4-gcc34-opt/lib/  path to the correct name.

4. Run the progam:

> ./MakeEff inputFile histoname DataType EffName EffType EffVersion ObjQuality ObjType ObjVersion ObjAlgorithm EffVarNames

inputFile is the file that contains the efficiency maps
histoname is the histogram that should be transformed in an mcr file
The rest of the parameters is the MetaData

So a possible command would be:

> ./MakeEff efficiencies.root LooseElectronEfficiency FastSim Binned Efficiency 1 loose Electron 1 Electron DetEta pT
