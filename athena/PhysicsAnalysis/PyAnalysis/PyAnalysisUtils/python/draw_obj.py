"""Helpers for drawing ROOT objects.
The main function in here is draw_obj(obj [, options]).
This is similar to obj->Draw(options), but some extra
functionality is added:

  - Automatic zone handling.  You can split the canvas into
    subpads (zones) with zone().  Each call to draw_obj() will
    plot into the next sequential pad (unless SAME was specified).
    Selecting a pad by clicking with button 2 will change
    the sequence so that the next objects is drawn in the
    selected pad.  draw_obj also takes an optional padnum
    argument to explicitly specify the pad number to use.

  - If the SAME option is given, then the new object will be
    superimposed on an existing one in the current pad.
    In the case of 1D histograms, we change the line
    type of the new histogram, and also rescale the vertical
    axis, if needed to make the new histogram fit.

  - The option MERGE is like SAME, except that we step through
    the pads as normal.  The new plot will be made on top of
    whatever happens to be on that pad.  By default, the line
    type used will be the same as one would get the first time
    one overlays a plot with SAME; to override this, put a number
    directly after the option, like `MERGE2'.

  - The option NORM draws the histogram normalized to 1.

  - The option LOGY draws the histogram using a logarithmic
    y-axis.

  - The line type will recycle after four histograms have
    been superimposed.  If the LINECOLORS option is given, then
    the new histograms will be drawn in a different color.

  - draw_obj takes optional min and max parameters to set the
    minimum and maximum values for the y-axis of the histogram
    being drawn.

Besides draw_obj, a few other functions are available.
zone(nx,ny) was already mentioned.
printeps(fname) is a shortcut to print an eps file from the current canvas.
get_canvas() returns the canvas currently being used for drawing.
get_pad() returns the pad currently being used for drawing.
