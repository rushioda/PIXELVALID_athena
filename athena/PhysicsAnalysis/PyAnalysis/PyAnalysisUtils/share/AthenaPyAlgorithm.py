# File: AthenaPyAlgorithm.py
# Created: sss, Mar 2005
# Purpose: Support for Athena algorithms written in Python.
#
# Including this job options file will define a class
# AthenaPyAlgorithm.  Derive from this in order to write Athena
# algorithms in Python.
#
# No longer needed, as the Gaudi PyAlgorithm has been fixed.
# This is now simply a reference to the Gaudi class.
#

AthenaPyAlgorithm = PyAlgorithm
