    <h1>Python Analysis Utilities</h1>

Here are some pieces of Python code of more-or-less general
applicability.  All these modules may be imported
from <samp>PyAnalysisUtils</code>.  The available modules are listed
below, classified according to their dependencies.


<h2>No Dependencies</h2>

The following modules are stand-alone and have no dependencies besides
Python.

<ul>
      <li> <samp>PDG</samp> This module contains names for the various
        PDG particle ID codes.  The names are the same as in
        <samp>EventKernel/PdtPdg.h</samp>.  The module also contains
        a function <samp>pdgid_to_name</samp> to convert a PDG ID code
        back to a printable string.  Example:
<pre>
    from PyAnalysisUtils import PDG
    if particle.pdgId() != PDG.mu:
        print PDG.pdgid_to_name (particle.pdgId())
</pre>

        <li> <samp>combo</samp> This module contains functions for
        generating all combinations and permutations from a list of
        items.  These functions return generators, so you may iterate
        over them or retrieve successive values with
        <samp>next()</samp>.  Given a sequence <samp>items</samp>,
        you can iterate over the list of unique pairwise combinations
        with
<pre>
    for (i1, i2) in combo.combinations (items, 2):
</pre>

        The functions contained in this module are:
        <ul>
          <li> <samp>combinations(items,n)</samp> Yields all
            unique subsequences of length <samp>n</samp> from
            <samp>items</samp>.  
          <li> <samp>all_combinations(items,n)</samp> Similar, but
            differences in ordering are considered significant.  For
            example, <samp>all_combinations([1,2,3],2)</samp> will yield
            both <samp>[1,2]</samp> and <samp>[2,1]</samp>.
          <li> <samp>permutations(items)</samp> Yields all
            permutations of <samp>items</samp>.  Equivalent
            to <samp>all_combinations(items,len(items))</samp>.
          <li> <samp>selections(items,n)</samp> Returns all possible
            ways of picking <samp>n</samp> items from
            <samp>items</samp>, where any given item may be picked
            multiple times.
        </ul>
        This module was copied from
        <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/">ASPN</a>
        with some changes of names.

      <li> <samp>interpolate</samp> This module does polynomial
        interpolation with in a table.  It is a python version of the
        code in <samp>CaloClusterCorrection/interpolate</samp> and
        derives from the <samp>divdif</samp> cernlib routine.
        Simple example of usage:
<pre>
    from PyAnalysisUtils.interpolate import interpolate
    points = [[0.05, 0.4424],
              [0.15, 0.4058],
              [0.25, 0.4753],
              [0.35, 0.7823],
              [0.45, 0.8636],
              [0.55, 0.9798],
              [0.65, 0.8224],
              [0.75, 0.7925]]
    print interpolate (points, 0.27, 3)
</pre>

        <li> <samp>normphi</samp> contains a function to normalize an
        angle to within the range -pi to pi.  Example:
<pre>
    from PyAnalysisUtils.normphi import normphi
    angle = normphi (angle)
</pre>

        The implementation here is intended for the case where the angle
        is known not to be huge (for example, the result of addition
        or subtraction of normalized angles).

      <li> <samp>rtime</samp> This module is used to measure the CPU
        time taken to execute a function.  For example, to time
        the call <samp>func(arg)</samp>, do:
<pre>
    from PyAnalysisUtils.rtime import rtime
    rtime (func, arg)
</pre>
        The report will be printed when the function returns.
</ul>

<h2>PyROOT Utilities</h2>

The following modules are intended to be used with PyROOT.

    <ul>
      <li> <samp>draw_obj</samp> has some helpers for drawing ROOT
        objects.
        <p>
          The main function in here is <samp>draw_obj(obj [,
          options])</samp>.
          This is similar to <samp>obj->Draw(options)</samp>, but some
          extra functionality is added:
        <ul>
          <li> Automatic zone handling.  You can split the canvas into
            subpads (zones) with <samp>zone()</samp>.  Each call to
            <samp>draw_obj()</samp> will
            plot into the next sequential pad (unless SAME was specified).
            Selecting a pad by clicking with button 2 will change
            the sequence so that the next objects is drawn in the
            selected pad.  <samp>draw_obj</samp> also takes an
            optional <samp>padnum</samp>
            argument to explicitly specify the pad number to use.
          
          <li> If the SAME option is given, then the new object will be
            superimposed on an existing one in the current pad.
            In the case of 1D histograms, we change the line
            type of the new histogram, and also rescale the vertical
            axis, if needed to make the new histogram fit.

          <li> The option MERGE is like SAME, except that we step through
            the pads as normal.  The new plot will be made on top of
            whatever happens to be on that pad.  By default, the line
            type used will be the same as one would get the first time
            one overlays a plot with SAME; to override this, put a number
            directly after the option, like `MERGE2'.

          <li> The option NORM draws the histogram normalized to 1.

          <li> The option LOGY draws the histogram using a logarithmic
            y-axis.

          <li> The line type will recycle after four histograms have
            been superimposed.  If the LINECOLORS option is given, then
            the new histograms will be drawn in a different color.

          <li> <samp>draw_obj</samp> takes optional <samp>min</samp>
            and <samp>max</samp> parameters to set the
            minimum and maximum values for the y-axis of the histogram
            being drawn.
        </ul>
        <p>
          Besides <samp>draw_obj</samp>, a few other functions are
          available.
          <ul>
          <li> <samp>zone(nx,ny)</samp> was already mentioned.
          <li> <samp>printeps(fname)</samp> is a shortcut to print an
            eps file from the current canvas.
          <li> <samp>get_canvas()</samp> returns the canvas currently
            being used for drawing.
          <li> <samp>get_pad()</samp> returns the pad currently being
            used for drawing.
          </ul>

      <li> <samp>rebin2</samp> This module allows rebinning 2D
        histograms.  For example, to rebin a 10x10 histogram into
        a 5x2 histogram, use:
<pre>
    from PyAnalysisUtils.rebin2 import rebin2
    # Group together 2 bins in x, 5 in y.
    hnew = rebin2 (h, 'newname', 2, 5)
</pre>

      <li> <samp>root_pickle</samp> This module allows pickling python
        objects into a root file.  The python objects may contain
        references to named root objects.  If one has set up a structure
        of python objects to hold root histograms, this provides a
        convenient way of saving and restoring your histograms.
        The pickled python data are stored in an additional string
        object in the root file; any root objects are stored as usual.
        (Thus, root files written by <samp>root_pickle</samp> can be
        read just like any other root file if you don't care about the
        python data.)

        Here's an example of writing a pickle:
<pre>
    import ROOT
    from PyAnalysisUtils.root_pickle import dump_root
    hlist = []
    for i in range (10):
        name = 'h%d' % i
        hlist.append (ROOT.TH1F (name, name, 10, 0, 10))
    dump_root (hlist, 'test.root')

</pre>
        This writes a list of histograms to <samp>test.root</samp>.
        The histograms may be read back like this:
<pre>
    import ROOT
    from PyAnalysisUtils.root_pickle import load_root
    hlist = load_root ('test.root')
</pre>

        The following additional notes apply.
        <ul>
          <li> In addition to <samp>dump_root</samp> and
            <samp>load_root</samp>, the module also provides
            <samp>dump</samp> and <samp>load</samp> functions, which
            take root <samp>TFile</samp> objects instead of file names.

          <li> The present version of <samp>root_pickle</samp> will
            not work correctly for the case of python objects deriving
            from root objects.  It will probably also not work for the
            case of root objects which do not derive from
            <samp>TObject</samp>.

          <li> When the pickled data are being read, if a class
            doesn't exist, <samp>root_pickle</samp> will create a
            dummy class with no methods and use that.  This is
            different from the standard pickle behavior (where it
            would be an error), but it simplifies usage in the common
            case where the class is being used to hold histograms, and
            its methods are entirely concerned with filling the
            histograms.
        </ul>

      <li> <samp>style</samp> This module centralizes the style
        settings I use for root plots.

      <li> <samp>pydraw</samp> provides in python functionality
            similar to <samp>TTree::Draw</samp> and
            <samp>TTree::Scan</samp>.  The major conceptual differences are:
       <ul>
         <li> All expressions are written in python (and not the specialized
              <samp>TTree::Draw</samp> language).
         <li> This can be applied to any type of object providing a
               simple loop interface, not just to <samp>TTree</samp>'s.
               (A <samp>TTree</samp> will work too!)
       </ul>
       In addition, this style of query may be somewhat
       easier to type interactively.

       Here are some examples of plotting commands to give you the flavor:

       <ul>
        <li><samp>d tt.metx</samp>
        <li><samp>d tt.ele_pt$i; 50 0 100*gev</samp>
        <li><samp>d tt.metx:mety</samp>
        <li><samp>d tt[100:1000].muo$i.pt() if abs(muo.eta)&lt;2</samp>
        <li><samp>d tt.(ele$i+ele$j).m() if $i&lt;$j; same</samp>
        <li><samp>scan tt.metx:mety</samp>
       </ul>

       For full details, see pydraw.py.

    </ul>


<h2>Athena Utilities</h2>

    These modules are intended to be used within an Athena-based
    analysis.

    <ul>
      <li> <samp>truth</samp> This module contains the function
        <samp>dump_truth</samp>, which tries do dump out the MC truth
        information in a readable format.  Here's an example:

<pre>

</pre>

        The first number is the particle barcode number.  This is
        followed by the particle type, and then by the barcode numbers
        of any decay daughters (up to 3).  This is followed by the
        four-momemtum in two versions: first as pt, eta, phi, m, and
        then as px, py, pz, e.
    </ul>
