    <h1>Writing an Athena algorithm in Python</h1>

To define an algorithm directly in Python, derive from the
Gaudi Python class <samp>PyAlgorithm</samp>.
A complete usage example is shown below.
To actually run this file, you'll need to replace the name of the
input data file with some data file that you have.  If it's not
fast simulation, then you may also need to change the collection
name used in the <samp>getElectrons</samp> call.

<pre>
# read AOD
include( "AthenaPoolCnvSvc/ReadAthenaPool_jobOptions.py" )
EventSelector = Service( "EventSelector" )
EventSelector.InputCollections = [
# Replace this with some input file that you can read.
  "AODfile.pool.root",
]
include( "ParticleEventAthenaPool/AOD_PoolCnv_jobOptions.py" )
theApp.Dlls += ["TruthParticleAlgs"]
include ("PyAnalysisCore/InitPyAnalysisCore.py")

class Alg (PyAlgorithm):
    def execute (self):
        # This is set up for reading fast simulation data.
        # Replace the collection name below if needed.
        for e in PyParticleTools.getElectrons ('AtlfastElectronCollection'):
            print e.pt(),
        print
        return 1

theApp.initialize()
theApp.addAlgorithm (Alg ('alg'))
theApp.run(100)
theApp.finalize()

</pre>
