General Info
=============
This package provides the central RIO_OnTrackCreator tool 
for turning PrepRawData into RIO_OnTrack, i.e applying
track-candidate dependent position and error corrections
to the hits. It also provides central error scaling.
The concrete corrections are in the responsibility of
the sub-detectors.

Documentation is on the wiki:
Atlas.TrkToolInterfaces      (abstract interface)
Atlas.TrkRIO_OnTrackCreator  (this package)


Recipe for error scaling and upload to conditions:
- set up cmt and example package (to get AthenaPOOL etc)
- create local DB with py script from ./share:
  python make_trkerror.py
- try local DB out by adding to reco job options:
  IOVDbSvc.Folders += \
  ["<dbConnection>impl=cool;techno=sqlite;schema=mycool.db;X:OFLP130</dbConnection> /GLOBAL/TrkErrorScaling <tag>GlobalTrkErrorScaling_nominal</tag> " ]
- once constants are considered "final", upload the local SQlite file
  to COOL by following the instructions on
  Atlas.CoolPublishing
