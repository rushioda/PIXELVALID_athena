# Pattern to build the dict lib. User should create a single header
# file: <package>Dict.h which includes all other .h files. See MissingETDict
# A selection file must be created by hand. This file lists the
# classes to be added to the dictionary, and which fields are
# transient. It should be put in ../<package> dir and is conventionally called
# selection.xml.
