@mainpage The TrkEventUtils package


@section intro Overview
The TrkEventUtils package holds small utilities for working with Tracking EDM objects.
Such utilities comprise sorting functions, object transformationa and extraction,
truth mappers and object manipulators. See under the 'classes' section for details on
each utility.

Note that the event data primitives, which formerly had also been part of this
package, have been moved to a separate location, TrkEventPrimitives, with release 10.4.0.
