This Package contains useful utilities for creating the TrackingGeometry.

@section TrkDetDescrIntro Introduction

The classes in this package are purely inline for speed optimisation or
for the fact that they are class templates.
The package contains a Trk::BinnedArray template class that allows to order 
geometrical objects into an array of 1-dim or 2-dim binning. The binning is done by Trk::BinUtility
classes of different implementations.

In addition it contains geometry statics and a reference counting class.
