/**
 * @class Trk::AdaptiveMultiVertexFitter
 *
 * 
 * @author N. Giacinto Piacquadio (Freiburg ATLAS Group)
 *
 *
 * This class implements a multi vertex fitting algorithm 
 * which is adaptive and robust, quite insensitive to the presence 
 * of outliers.
 *
 * The multi-vertex version of the fit is more complicate than the 
 * single-vertex version and needs the input to be provided in the form 
 * of a vector of already initialized MVFVxCandidate objects. Details of the 
 * the objects to provide in the fit() and addVtxTofit() functions.
 *
 * During the multi-vertex fit all the vertices are fit, using the tracks 
 * which are contained in their respective vertex candidates. Tracks which are 
 * shared among more than one vertex get their weights adjusted dynamically 
 * iteration after iteration thanks to a Deterministic Annealing 
 * procedure, so that in the end they are dinamically assigned to the 
 * vertex they most probably belong to.
 *
 * As for the single-vertex fitter, for 
 * greater modularity the algorithm is divided into 6 
 * modules (AlgTools in Athena):
 *
 * 1. LinearizedTrackFactory
 * 2. TrackCompatibilityEstimator
 * 2b. ImpactPoint3dEstimator
 * 3. VertexUpdator
 * 4. VertexSmoother
 * plus another one, which is responsible for letting the temperature go down 
 * (which implements the so called "annealing technique")
 * 5. AnnealingMaker
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Changes:
 *
 * David Shope <david.richard.shope@cern.ch> (2016-04-19)
 *
 * EDM Migration to xAOD - from Trk::VxCandidate to xAOD::Vertex, 
 *                         from Trk::RecVertex   to xAOD::Vertex,
 *                         from Trk::Vertex      to Amg::Vector3D
 *
 * Also, VxMultiVertex EDM has been migrated to the following:
 *   
 *   Trk::MvfFitInfo  
 *     constraintVertex     now uses xAOD::Vertex
 *     seedVertex           now uses Amg::Vector3D
 *     linearizationVertex  now uses Amg::Vector3D
 *
 *   Trk::TrackToVtxLink
 *     Vertex objects stored using this class are now xAOD::Vertex
 *
 * Instead of using the MVFVxCandidate class, xAOD::Vertex is employed by decorating it
 * with the multi-vertex information:
 *
 *   bool                              isInitialized
 *   MvfFitInfo*                       MvfFitInfo
 *   std::Vector<VxTrackAtVertex*>     VTAV
 *
 *   This last decoration is needed in order to be able to use MVFVxTrackAtVertex objects
 *   which have the additional information of xAOD::Vertices associated to the track
 *   and (through polymorphism) to still be able to pass them to the KalmanVertexUpdator as
 *   VxTracksAtVertex objects.
 *
 *   This is obviously not an ideal implementation and could be avoided if xAOD::Vertex
 *   stored a std::vector<VxTrackAtVertex*> instead of a std::vector<VxTrackAtVertex>,
 *   but I think it must remain this way until such a time as the xAOD::Vertex EDM
 *   is changed.

     * contain also a pointer to the MVFVxCandidate among the vertex candidates the track belongs to.
     * 
     * There are three steps:
     *
     * 1) the new vertex is added to the fit (all the tracks get initialized, so that the Plane through their 
     *    IP point and the seed vertex (IP3dAtAPlane) is created, to be later able to estimate in a fast way 
     *    the compatibility of the tracks to their respective vertices.
     *
     * 2) all tracks belonging to the new vertex are scanned and all the vertices which shares tracks with the new vertex 
     *    to be fit are also added to the fit.
     *
     * 3) the multivertex fit is performed with all the involved vertices.
     *
     * This has the clear advantage that only vertices which are really affected by adding the new vertex are being 
     * refitted, improving the overall finding performance.
