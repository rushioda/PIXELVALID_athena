\mainpage The TrkAlignGenAlgs package

\section introduction Introduction

This package provides algorithms for alignment of the muon spectrometer or the inner detector not specific to either detector or to any specific alignment method.

The algorithms provided are:

  - AlignAlg - main algorithm that calls alignment tools for alignment.

  - SelectEventNumber - algorithm that can be called before track fitting to select only events 
	with run/event numbers listed in an ASCII file.
