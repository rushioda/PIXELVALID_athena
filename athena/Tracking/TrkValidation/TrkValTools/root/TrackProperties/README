TrackProperties

Stand-alone ROOT application that produces TH1's and TH2's of 
track properties, plots them and stores them in a root file 
(histTrkProp.root) for further analysis.
This application reads a rootFile and gets an ntuple or tree 
(e.g. ValidationNtuple written by the BasicValidationNtupleTool 
from /Tracking/TrkValidation/TrkValTools) contained in a directory.


compile in ROOT with:

.L TH1TrkProp.cxx++
.L TH2TrkProp.cxx++
.L createTrkProp.cxx++

run in ROOT:

createTrkProp()
