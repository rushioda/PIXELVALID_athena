*************IMPORTANT*****************
1)TileCosmicView needs ROOT>=5.14
  The version shipped with Athena 12.0.X
  is not recent enough.

2)To run, just type
  root TileCosmicView.C

3)The input ntuple must contain TileMuonFitter tree
  which is not on by default in the reconstruction

4)To select a cell shift+click

***************************************
If one wishes to make changes in the geometry.  Then after editing TileGeoBuild.C.
> root -l
> .L TileGeoBuild.C++
> build();
This builds the TileGeom.root file.  Now you can run TileCosmicView as above but with a new geometry.
