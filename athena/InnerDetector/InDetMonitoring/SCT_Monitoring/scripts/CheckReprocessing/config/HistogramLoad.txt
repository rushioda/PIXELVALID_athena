# This file specifies the histograms to load from the input data, and the comparisons to perform on them
# 
# Bash-style comments are supported, i.e. anything following a # symbol will be ignored
# Empty lines should also be ignored
#
# There must be a minimum of three columns in this file, separated by spaces:
# 1) The name(s) of the comparison(s) to perform
# 2) The argument(s) defining the comparison(s)
# 3) The name(s) of the histogram(s) to perform the comparison(s) on, including full path
#
# The comparisons available are:
# "binwise" - compare the values in corresponding bins. Allows a percentage variation given by the argument. Assumes identical binning.
# "binwiseHack" - same as above, but specify different allowed fluctuation for each x bin, eg 3.5:2.0:2.0:1.0 etc
# "kolmogorov" - perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov comparison of the histograms. Allow a probability of matching greater than given by the argument.
# "mean" - compare histogram mean values. Argument either "reduce", "increase", or an allowed percentage change.
# "sigma" - compare histogram sigma values. Argument either "reduce", "increase", or an allowed percentage change.
# "entries" - compare the total number of histogram entries. Allows a percentage variation given by the argument.
#
# A histogram name and path is specified by a series of space-separated text strings.
# Each string must be contained by the histogram/directory name at the corresponding path depth.
# As an example,            SCT GENERAL noise * will match any histogram in the directory /          140541/SCT/GENERAL/noise
# 
# Search operators are supported:
# Comma (,) means AND
# Exclamation mark (!) means NOT
# There is no OR function, just use a new line
#
# For more information on the search methods, see ../doc/SearchMethods.txt
#
# To apply multiple comparisons to histograms that match a single search string, separate the somparison names with commas (,)
# There must be a corresponding argument for each comparison, again separated by commas
# For example: mean,sigma 2.0,improve <some histogram path> will compare the mean of the histograms, allowing a 2.0% variation, and will compare sigma values looking for improvement (reduction)
#
# If a comparison needs no argument, just write any old thing, but you can't skip it
#
# Columns should be as follows:
# Comparisons            Arguments             Path1 Path2 Path3 ...
