This directory holds some code that should be useful for reading back some of
the trigger information from D3PDs. Some information dumped by the TriggerD3PDMaker
package needs expert knowledge to decode, this is where these classes should help.

The Makefile is configured to create a library called libTriggerD3PDHelpers.so.
It only needs a functioning ROOT release for this, you can compile the helper
library without Athena. (But it also compiles within the athena environment of
course.)

The tool needs branches created by TrigDecisionD3PDObject and
addTrigCongMetadata(...) to function. If these are not present, it will complain.

A simple interactive usage of the library would look like this:

> root -l myD3PD.root
...
root [1] .L libTriggerD3PDHelpers.so
root [2] TTree* confTree = ( TTree* ) _file0->Get( "egammaMeta/TrigConfTree" );
root [3] D3PD::TrigDecisionToolD3PD tool( egamma, confTree );
root [4] tool.GetEntry( 5 );
root [5] cout << tool.IsPassed( "L1_MBTS_1_1" ) << endl;
  Will be probably 0 because of prescaling...
root [6] cout << tool.IsPassed( "L1_MBTS_1_1", 4 ) << endl;
  Will probably be 1 for collision events...

At the moment the code is more or less just a prototype, more functionality
will be added gradually. For more information you should look at the Doxygen
documentation put into the source files.
