@mainpage Event filters for Cosmic events

@section IntroductionInDetCosmicsFilters Introduction

This package contains currently one filter for Cosmic events. 

The filter (TrackFilter) selects
those events that contain at least one good track in any specified trackcollection. This is meant for Cosmics in the pit where most of the events triggered by the Muon or Calorimeter don't have a track in the Inner Detector.
