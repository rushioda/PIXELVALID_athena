This package provides transient classes to hold the ID aligment tracking
informtion produced by the algorithms in InDetAlignAlgs, which also provides
facilities for writing them to ntuples.

Classes:
  AlignSiHit    - information on one silicon hit
  AlignTRTHit   - information on one TRT hit
  AlignSiModule - information on one silicon module (for ntuple 110)
  AlignTrk      - information on one tracks (for ntuple 100)
  AlignTrkContainer - Storegate container for AlignTrk

Note that this package used to exist as 
  InnerDetector/InDetAlignment/InDetAlignTrkInfo
but was moved to 
  InnerDetector/InDetAlignEvent/InDetAlignTrkInfo
in November 2005
