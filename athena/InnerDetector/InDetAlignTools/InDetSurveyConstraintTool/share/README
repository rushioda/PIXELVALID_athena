This package incorporates the SCT and Pixel survey data into the
alignment as survey constraints, given the statistical and systematic
uncertainties associated with the survey data.

The package is implemented as a tool. The actual tool is called
SurveyConstraint and can be retrieved using the ToolService.

This Tool can be called from any alignment algorithm (e.g. which uses
track residual information). The main routine is called
computeConstraint, it returns the mean vector, the weight matrix, the
alignment parameters and chi^2 per module. This allows a
straightforward combination of the survey constraints with any
other alignment algorithm.

The test algorithm SurveyConstraintTestAlg shows how to implement the
tool.

Two instances of the conditions DB will be used to access the current
(to be aligned) and the survey conditions data, the latter is being
put in place by Richard Hawkings. In the default version of the tool
the current and the survey data are identical (nominal values) and
trivially all alignment parameters are zero.

At the moment only the survey constraint for Pixel endcap modules is
implemented.

More detailed information:
The SurveyConstraint tool makes use of three additional 
classes:
- SurveyConstraintModule: Provides bookkeeping of the 
  survey constraints, it represents the survey data for
  a single module.
- SurveyConstraintPoint: represents the actual survey
  points in global coordinates of the current and the 
  survey alignment. 
- SimpleConstraintPointMinimizer: Simple algorithm to 
  minimize the distance between two sets of points.
