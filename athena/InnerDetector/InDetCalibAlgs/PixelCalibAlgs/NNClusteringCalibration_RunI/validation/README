Validation code for NN:
 
- reads the tree NNinput of a Pixel Cluster Validation Ntuple 
- initalize and call the the NN 
- process the NNinput
- produce a TrkValidation Ntuple with a "fake" CombinedInDetTracks tree with the processed clusters

It is possible to use standard calibration code to produce validation plots

The list of the input files has to be stored in the files: files.txt and filesOnTrack.txt


The recommendation is to use a  reliable compiled version:

ln -s ../libTJetNet.so
ln -sf  libTJetNet.so libTJetNet.so.0
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD

make clean; make

./produceTrkValidation 1 false -1 outname.root

arguments:
1- number of particles
2- use track information
3- number of events to process
4- output file name
 

It is also possible to use a function inside root:
root -l doWriteNtuple.C\(1,false\)

It takes as arguments:
1. number of particle. To produce the validation ntuple for the NN trained in the 1/2/3 particles hypothesis
2. useTrack Info.      Use the NN traine with or without track information
