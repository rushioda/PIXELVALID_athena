@section SiSpacePointFormationIntro Introduction

This package contains the algorithm to create Space Points for the Pixels and
SCT detectors. For the Pixels it is just a transformation of classes from
clusters to Space Points while for the SCT it combines the 1-dimensional 
information of two SCT clusters into a Space Point.
This algorithm is used in the offline reconstruction.

@section SiSpacePointFormationOverview Algorithm Overview
  The SiSpacePointFormation package contains the following algorithms:

   - SiTrackerSpacePointFinder: It retrieves all the Pixels and SCT clusters
   and creates the SpacePoints containers: one for Pixels and two for SCT 
   non-overlapping SpacePoints. The overlapping SCT SpacePoints are saved
   in a different collection. 
   Non-overlapping means that a SpacePoint is created from 2 clusters of the 
   same module and overlapping when they are created from 2 clusters which 
   are in different but overlapping modules.
   
   The algorithm uses the classes SiElementPropertiesTable and 
   SiElementProperties in order to access, for the SCT, the backside wafer
   of a given module and the neighbour ones from other modules.
