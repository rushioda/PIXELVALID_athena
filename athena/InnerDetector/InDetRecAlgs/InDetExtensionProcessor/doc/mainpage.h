@mainpage The InDetExtensionProcessor package

The InDetExtensionProcessor package provides algorithms which
form part of the Inner Detector track reconstruction sequence [1].

Currently there is one algorithm, InDet::InDetExtensionProcessor,
which is run at the end of the inside-out track finding to
evaluate by means of a full track fit if a proposed extension
of TRT hits matches with the associated silicon track.
Three possible situations are treated in this algorithm:
 - For a given Si track no extension is proposed. The original Si track is kept unmodified.
 - For a given Si track an extension is proposed, but the track fit failed or gives a worse score than the initial Si track. A new track object is then made with the additional TRT hits added as outlier states and the original Si track fit result.
 - For a given Si track an extension is proposed, and the additional hits have improved the track score. The new fit result is kept and a new Track made.

The algorithm is coded in a general way and can work with any combination
of original tracks and associated extensions given through a
Trk::TrackExtensionMap and with any type of track fitter.
