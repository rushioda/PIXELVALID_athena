@section SiSPSeededTrackFinderIntro Introduction

This algorithm is devoted to track finding using Pixels and SCT clusters starting from space point seeds
information. Output of this algorithm is Trk::Track collection. 

This algorithm uses three standard tools.

1. ISiSpacePointsSeedMaker - space point seeds maker tool.
2. ISiZvertexMake          - primary verices search tool.
3. ISiTrackMaker           - local track-finding in Pixels and SCT tool.
