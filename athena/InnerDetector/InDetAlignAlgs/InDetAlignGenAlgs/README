This package provides algorithms to produce the 'alignment ntuples' used
for silicon alignment studies, and to manipulate the alignment information
in the conditions database.
Documentation in the doc subdirectory. The alignment database objects 
are described in doc/InDetAlignDBS.txt

Note: This package was previously known as InDetAlignAlgs and resided in
the container InnerDetector/InDetAlignment/

Algorithms:
  InDetAlignNt - silicon hit/residual ntuple production 
                 (see doc/InDetAlignNt.txt)
  InDetAlignWrt - create the transient objects and optionally write to the
             conditions database via FillIOVTool (see doc/InDetAlignWrt.txt)
  InDetAlignTBEx - use the AlignTrks produced by InDetAlignNt to produce
             residual histograms for the Si detectors in the testbeam,
             compute alignment constant corrections, and save them back in the 
             conditions database.
             To be used as an infrastructure example to slot in more 
             sophisticated alignment algorithms. This is obselete and has
             been removed!

In general this package should be run from InDetRecExample, by including a
use statement to InDetAlignAlgs and one or more of the joboption file fragments
in the share directory. Alternatively the example/alignjobOptions.py file
contains a complete set of job options to run a reconstruction + alignment
job in the InDetRecExample framework, and alignESDjobOptions.py contains
job options to run alignment ntuple production from previously written
ESDs.
