This directory contains the files used when you do 'make check' in cmt/

It runs jobOptions.py and saves the output as InDetRecExampleTesting.log.
This is then grepped for ERROR WARNING FATAL and 'Application finalised' messages and a 
stripped output is produced: InDetRecExampleTesting.log_stripped. This is compared to a
stripped 'reference' file - if they differ then a failure is announced.

So to update the test, run make check, then rename run/InDetRecExampleTesting.log to
test/Reference_InDetRecExampleTesting.log
