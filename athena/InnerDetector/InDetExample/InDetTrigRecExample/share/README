This directory contains the various fragments and complete jobOptions needed for Inner 
Detector Trigger Reconstuction.
 
In /run do the following:
> source ../share/Setup.sh
for running:
> athena.py -bs jobOptions.py

Complete jobOptions (copied to /run):
-------------------
 
jobOptions.py     - this uses POOL datasets and runs the complete EFID reconstruction
 
jobOptions.py is copied to the run/ directory and it is suggested that you modify it there. 
In general you should only
need to alter the doBlah flags (i.e. set doTruth=FALSE/TRUE), and the InDetFlags You may 
also need to modify the dataset used.
 
jobOptions Fragments (kept in share/)
--------------------
You should not need to modify the file:
InDetTrigRec_jobOptions.py         - the main InDetTrigRec fragment. This sets up the 
various algorithms used in the ID reconstruction.            
 
Misc files which aren't maintained any more
-------------------------------------------
ByteStream_Setup.sh
ByteStream_jobOptions.py
WriteInDetAOD.py
WriteInDetESD.py
