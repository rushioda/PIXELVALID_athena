<!-- 
  This is the file intended to be 'Xincluded' to a mother file. Note that both the 
  mother file AND this file must be fully well-formed XML. If you wish to check the 
  files individually, you can use the 'xmllint' command like: 
                            xmllint inc.xml
  If you wish to check the assembled whole file, with the xincludes added, you can use:
                            xmllint - -xinclude mother.xml
  (note: no space between the two hyphens!)
  where 'mother.xml' is the name of the mother file containing the xi:include instruction.
