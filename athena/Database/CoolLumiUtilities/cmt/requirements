# Change to dual_use library since the lcgdict pattern doesn't work with a component library
# for cmake because one can't link against a component. This pollutes the libraries to be 
# linked against for any clients in CMT, but is otherwise harmless because the as-needed linkopt

# file: <package>Dict.h which includes all other .h files. See EventInfoDict
# A selection file must be created by hand. This file lists the
# classes to be added to the dictionary, and which fields are
# transient. It should be put in ../<package> dir and is conventionally called
# selection.xml.
