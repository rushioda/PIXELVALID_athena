 * @author scott snyder <snyder@bnl.gov>
 * @date Dec, 2006
 * @brief Base class for Root converters.
 *
 * This header defines the base class @c TVirtualConverter,
 * to be used for conversions between different versions
 * of a class when reading data.
 *
 * We need to keep track of a couple different classes here.
 * The `transient' class is the class that we want to read.
 * It must have the same name in the persistent store
 * (this restriction may be removed later).
 * The `shape' of the persistent version of the class may,
 * however, differ from the transient version.  We thus
 * identify a second, `persistent' class which gives the shape
 * of the class that's expected in the persistent store.
 * (In the future, we may remove the limitation that this be
 * an actual class known to root and allow root `emulated' classes
 * to be used.)
 * The converter must then know how to initialize a transient
 * object from a persistent one.
 *
 * Three pieces of information are needed to properly register the converter.
 * First, the name of the transient class.
 * Second, the name of the persistent class.
 * Third, the root checksum for the persistent class shape we want
 * to read.  If this is not supplied, then one will be calculated
 * based on the name of the transient class and the contents of the
 * persistent class.  This is usually what's needed; however, if you're
 * relying on automatic schema evolution to read the persistent class
 * (i.e., what you've declared in your program isn't exactly the
 * same as the stored class), then you'll need to specify the checksum
 * explicitly.
 *
 * To make this a little more concrete, say you have:
 *
 *@code
 *  struct T { int a; };
 @endcode
 *
 * that you've saved to root.  You later change this to:
 *
 *@code
 *  struct T { double a2; };
 @endcode
 *
 * Now, root's automatic schema evolution won't be able to read this
 * properly, because it doesn't have any way to connect a2 to a.
 * You can still read the data with a converter.  Make an additional
 * class
 *
 *@code
 *  struct T_old { int a; };
 @endcode
 *
 * Then make a converter class.  The easiest thing to do is to use
 * the template class @c TVirtualConverter_T:
 *
 *@code
 *  class T_Conv
 *    : public TVirtualConverter_T<T, T_old>
 *  {
 *  public:
 *    void Convert (T* transobj, const T_old* persobj)
 *    { transobj->a2 = persobj->a; }
 *  };
 @endcode
 *
 * Here, the class names and the checksum are all provided by default.
 * If you need to override them, they can be specified to the base class
 * constructor.
 *
 * In order to perform the conversion, a temporary instance of the
 * persistent object must be created.  By default, this is done
 * via @c TClass::New, and then later destroyed using @c TClass::Destructor.
 * This can be changed by overriding the @c NewPersObj and @c DeletePersObjs
 * methods of @c TVirtualConverter.
 *
 * Once a converter instance has been created, it should be registered
 * with @c TConverterRegistry.
