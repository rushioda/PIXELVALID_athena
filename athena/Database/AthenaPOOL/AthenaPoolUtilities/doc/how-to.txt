This is a brief how-to which explains how to generate the pool
converters for one or more data packages. (See the corresponding
how-to in the AtlasSEAL package for how to generate a SEAL dictionary
for you data classes.)

Pool converters are automatically generated using a cmt pattern. By
conventions, the generation is done in a single package for a number
of classes. For example, the InDet Event classes are done in the
InnerDetector/InDetEventCnv/InDetEventAthenaPool package. We use this
package as an example.

1) Rule 1: each class must be declared in a separate .h file. For
   example, InDetRawData/PixelRDO_Container.h holds the definition of
   only the PixelRDO Container.

2) In the requirements file of converter package one has:

package InDetEventAthenaPool

author  Davide Costanzo <Davide.Costanzo@cern.ch>

use AtlasPolicy          AtlasPolicy-* 
use AthenaPoolUtilities  AthenaPoolUtilities-00-*   Database/AthenaPOOL
use InDetRawData         InDetRawData-01-*	    InnerDetector/InDetRawEvent

# temporarily add in explicit link to dictionary
macro_append InDetEventAthenaPool_linkopts " -lInDetRawDataDict "

apply_pattern poolcnv files="-s=${InDetRawData_root}/InDetRawData PixelRDO_Container.h SCT_RDO_Container.h TRT_RDO_Container.h "


The "use AthenaPoolUtilities" is needed to get the poolcnv
pattern. The other users should refer to packages with data objects
which need converters.

One should provide the list of header files for the pattern
"poolcnv". These can be taken from a number of packages following the
syntax of "-s=${<package>_root}/<package> <hdr1> hdr2>" which can be
repeated. 

The necessary "uses" should be done to the packages with the header
files. 

Finally, one should temporarily link against the dictionary libraries
containing the object descriptions needed by the converter. This is
done by adding the library names in the list of <package>_linkopts as
seen above. Note that this will be automated in the future so that the
dictionaries will be loaded when needed. When this happens the
<package>_linkopts will need to be removed.
