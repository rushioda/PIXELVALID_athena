CoralDB

This is CoralDB, a relational database prototype for the pixel connectivity
database.

Until we're using a proper configuration management tool such as cmt, please
use setup.csh as provided in this directory to properly set all environment
variables required for building and running CoralDB.

The top level directory (where this README file is located) contains the
C++ code as well as utility scripts to import the initial connectivity
database contents from a spreadsheet through CSV files.

The perl subdirectory contains a read-only Perl API to CoralDB in module
CoralDB.pm, plus a number of Perl-based tools (including the code for
the CoralDB web browser and utilities to create connectivity graphs).

The cgi-bin subdirectory contains scripts that apart from setting up
the proper environment call the main Perl CGI scripts located in the
perl subdirectory.

Please contact Juerg Beringer (juerg.beringer AT cern.ch) with any questions
or comments.
