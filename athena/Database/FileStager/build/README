* cleanup.sh            Clean up build directory (delete files created during
                        build etc.)
* generate_filelists.sh Prints listing of source files for usage in Makefile.am

Files
=====

* configure.ac          autoconf input file
* Makefile.am           automake input file
* package-config.in     Template for package-config script

Standalone build
================

Run ./standalone_build.sh [--prefix INSTALLDIR]

Files will be installed to INSTALLDIR. The default is /usr.

Make sure that the directories where config scripts of required
packages can be found have been added to the PATH variable.

After the successful installation, you will have to set
  export PATH=INSTALLDIR/bin:$PATH
  export LD_LIBARARY_PATH=INSTALLDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to be able to use the package (e.g. add it to ~/.bashrc).
