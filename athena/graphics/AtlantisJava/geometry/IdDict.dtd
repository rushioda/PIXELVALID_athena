<!-- IdDict: Identifier Dictionary
     ==========================

   o This describes the possible identifier ranges.

   o One may describe several identifier dictionaries, each by a IdDictionary element.
     A dictionary is identified by its name.

   o Each dictionary may describe :

      + individual identifier fields ("field"). 

          - This is useful when the field values are individually labelled.
          - purely numeric fields do not need to be explicitly
            described, in which case, their possible ranges will be deduced from the defined
            regions.

      + identifier regions ("region").

          - they are the alternate identifier ranges for this dictionary.
          - a region specifies a contiguous range of identifiers, complete for the dictionary.
          - it may be labelled with a "name".
	  - it may also have a "tag" (see alternate regions)
          - it contains the ordered list of fields with their explicit value range.
          - each entry in this list may be 
             - a range assigned to a given field ("range")
             - a reference to a subregion ("reference") (see below)
             - a reference to a complete identifier domain ("identifiers")
	     - a list of alternative ranges which are differentiated according 
	       to their tag ("alternate_ranges")

      + alternate regions ("alternate_regions").

          - this contains two or more alternate region specifications
          which are differentiated by their "tag". An empty tag is
          default. This allows at generation time to select a specific
          tag.

      + subregions ("subregion")

          - A subregion speficies a contiguous range of identifiers, describing a 
            subset of the identifier fields in the dictionary.
          - it must identified by a name.
          - the role of subregions is to be referenced by regions, and they typically describe
            the parts that are common to several regions.
