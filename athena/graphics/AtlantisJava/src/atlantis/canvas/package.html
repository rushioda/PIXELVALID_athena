<p>Provides classes representing the Atlantis canvas and the windows
  displayed within it.</p>
<p>The ACanvas is a JFrame containing a JlayeredPane of AWindows. Windows
are placed into the JLayeredPane depending on the current layout. The
canvas class contains a HashTable of all possible windows and a
HashTable of all available layouts. Windows needed by the current
layout are added to the JLayeredPane according to the size and the
order defined by the layout.  An AWindow is a JPanel into which the
Atlantis graphics are drawn. Each window has an associated projection
and also an interaction manager. The interaction manager is a mouse
listener which deals with all mouse events on the window. The window
manages the drawing of the Atlantis picture and deals with the linear
transformations from user to display co-ordinates.  Non-linear
transformations are dealt with by the projection. ALayout defines the
size and position (in the 3x3 grid layout scheme of the layered pane)
of each window, and also describes combinations of these windows
called pages. pages is an array of characters where each character
represents a window.</p>
