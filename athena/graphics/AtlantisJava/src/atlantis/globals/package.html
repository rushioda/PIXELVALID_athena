<p>Provides access to Atlantis global variables.</p>
<p>This has been introduced as part of a process of breaking unwanted
  dependencies between packages. This package can contain any required
  global state so that other packages (atlantis.data etc.) do not need
  to depend on the "atlantis" package that contains the main Atlantis
  class, and which unavoidably depends on the rest of the
  packages.</p>
<p>With luck this will prove not to be necessary in the long term!</p>
