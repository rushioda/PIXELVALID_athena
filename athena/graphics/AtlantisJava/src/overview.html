<p>Atlantis is an event display for the ATLAS experiment at
CERN's Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p>The primary goals of the program are the visual investigation and
  the understanding of the physics of complete events. Secondary goals
  are to help develop reconstruction and analysis algorithms, to
  facilitate debugging during commisioning and to provided a tool for
  creating pictures and animations for publications, presentations and
  exhibitions.</p>

<p>Atlantis is based on the ALEPH event display DALI.</p>

<p>Atlantis is written entirely in Java. JiveXML (event converter) is
  a C++ interface between Atlantis and the Athena ATLAS offline SW
  framework.</p>

<p>Atlantis event visualisation is a fast, interactive and intuitive
  application allowing study of complete ATLAS events.</p>
