   @section xAODTrigL1CaloCnvOverview Overview

   This package holds the components (algorithms and tools) that can be used
   to translate the Trigger/TrigT1/TrigT1CaloEvent objects that were used in ESD files, into the
   xAOD RoI objects/containers.
   
   Most users will only be interested in the python helper function
   xAODTrigL1CaloCreator. But it is also possible to make use of the converter tools
   of the package from the outside if necessary.

   @section xAODTrigL1CaloCnvTools Tool Interfaces
   
   It is possible to use the following tool interfaces to create xAOD objects
   out of ESD ones, from other packages as well:
   
   
   @htmlinclude used_packages.html

   @include requirements
