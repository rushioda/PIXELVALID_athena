The TrigCostPython package is a python package (as the name indicates)
that serves as an interface for the various trigger databases
(COOL/TRIGGER DB, TRP ntuples, XML files, IS server).

Although this package is mainly geared towards trigger experts (people
who worry about trigger rates being too high as well as other
problems), it may be useful for those who need to get their hands on
trigger rates NOW.  Check out exampleCost.py & makeRoot.py.
