MenuFast is a set of scripts for fast prediction of trigger rates in a
menu based on filtered ntuples. These were developed in 2012-2013 for
Run2 Trigger Menu development.
== L1menuFast.py for L1 menu by Brian Petersen
== L1TopomenuFast(Dev).py including L1Topo menu by Moritz Backes and 
== HLTmenuFast.py for HLT menu by Yu Nakahama (CERN)

Scripts for producing fitered ntuples from D3PDs are also available.
== L1filter5RoIsIsolation.py and
== HLTfilter.py
