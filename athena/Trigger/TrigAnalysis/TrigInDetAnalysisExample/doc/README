Analysis chains names
---------------------

Analysis chains can be specified, selecting an dactual chain, a specific track collection,
a TE from which it should originate, an RoI to be retrieved, and whether the chains should
be required to have passed.

New instructions
----------------

The preferred format for analysis chains now is


   ChainName:key=TrackCollectionName:roi=RoiName:vtx=VertexName

Other keys are available, and eg ";DTE" should be added at the end to use the deactivated 
Trigger Elements.

Old instructions - (from March 2015 and not largely out of date) 
----------------
To specify without an RoI the format of the chain names in the configuration ...

   ChainName:TrackCollectionKey:index:TriggerElementKey;DTE

where "index" is 0, 1, 2 etc for strategy A, B, C etc, DTE specifies deactivated trigger elements
also, and is separated by a semicolon ";" rather than a colon ":" as in all the other cases.

So with the new scheme, to specify the RoiDescriptor name, this instead becomes

   ChainName:TrackCollectionName:index:TriggerElementKey:Roi=RoiKey;DTE

ie, there is an extra field, separated by a ":" if you don't want to specify a trigger element,
then you still need this separator ie
 
  ChainName:TrackCollectionName:index::Roi=RoiKey;DTE

Note that this "Roi=" should be explicitly included at the start of the string, but also
"RoI=", "roi=" "ROI=" are all allowed. I will come back to this later.

Without specifying an Roi key, the default keys it uses are

  "forID"
  ""
  "initialRoI"

The above chain ie

   ChainName:TrackCollectionName:index:TriggerElementKey:Roi=RoiKey;DTE

should get encoded as

   ChainName:TrackCollectionName:index:TriggerElementKey:RoiKey;DTE

in the names of the chains in the ntple, and as

   ChainName_TrackCollectionName_index_TriggerElementKey_RoiKey_DTE

as the output names of the root directories in the post processing (":" and ";" are special
characters in root file names, and so are replaced by "_" in the directory names)
 
Of course, if DTE is not specified, or no index or TriggerElement are specifed, one
should include the spacers but with no index etc ...
 
    ChainName:TrackCollectionName:::roi=RoiKey

which will result in

    ChainName:TrackCollectionName:RoiKey
    ChainName_TrackCollectionName_RoiKey

as the chain, and root directory names. so for example

   HLT_mu24_L2Star_idperf:InDetTrigTrackingxAODCnv_Muon_EFID:::roi=forID

etc, exactly as one would hope.

So, just as this means that we can book different "analysis chains"
based on the same trigger chain, but with different track collections, we should now also
be able to specify different chains, differing only by the RoI, so that independent analyses of
the two steps in the two step tracking should be possible. Although the empty fields are
required to specify the chains, they are redundent in the output names, of the chains in the
ntple, so are not added.

As a word, note that the separateor for the "DTE" is a semi colon, ";" This is "chopped off"
from the end of the string when parsing, so empty ":" fields are not required for the TE and roi
(or index, and track collection etc) if these are not set, ie

   HLT_mu24_L2Star_idperf:InDetTrigTrackingxAODCnv_Muon_EFID;DTE

should be a perfectly valid chain. Although this might all sound complicated, it is actually
quite straightforward and pretty much completely how you might expect it to behave
intuitively.


In practice, the "roi=" is actually optional, although it is prefered that people include it
explicitly as there is the possibility in the future of specifying the chains with eg

  "ChainName:Collection=TrackCollection:roi=... :"

etc, so that the fields after the chain name itself, can just be added in any order and with any
number of different configuration parameters for clarity, however this *has* now been implemented.
