 TrigTimerSvc - Benchmarking service for the trigger

TrigTimerSvc is a utility to record timing information:

 o User defined timing statistics can be generated using TrigTimers created 
   and controlled by your code. This information can also be included in 
   the NTuples. As well as elapsed time, an unsigned integer can be associated
   with the time, eg. the number of tracks can be associated with the track 
   reconstruction time.

 o Timing Ntuples can be filled from the information available from 
   TrigTimerSvc using the HLTAlgo TrigTimeNtuple


The timing mechanism is based on an Athena Service TrigTimerSvc from which 
TrigTimers can be requested. The TrigTimers are controlled (started, stopped 
etc.) by the requesting algorithm, but the TrigTimerSvc retains ownership 
of the TrigTimers. This means that TrigTimerSvc can provide additional services 
such as end-of-run printing, or providing a list of all TrigTimers so that, 
for example, the execution times can be entered into an NTuple. 

Since the algorithms request individual TrigTimers, the timers are started and 
stopped directly. There is is no need for a potentially slow map access by 
string key, as is the case in the Gaudi Chrono Service.

For an example of use of these time utilities, see the TrigSiTreeAlg package.
