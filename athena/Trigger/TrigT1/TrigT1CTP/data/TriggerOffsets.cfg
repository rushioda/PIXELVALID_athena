# Trigger Offset Configuration
#
# File format:
# Everything after the first '#' in a line is ignored. It is
# NOT possible to escape the "comment symbol"! Therefore '#'
# must never be used as part of the configuration.
#
# The file consists of different sections. Each section is
# enclosed in a begin-end block:
#
#	begin SECTION_NAME
#	SECTION_DATA
#	end
#
# So far there are the following possible sections:
#
#	StaticOffsetMap	Configuration of static offsets
#			between trigger items
#
# The configuration of the sections follows these rules:
#
# 	StaticOffsetMap
#		The first value in a line has to be the
#		number of the trigger item that has to be
#		active in the TAV for the following offsets
#		to take effect.
#		The rest of the line has to consist of pairs
#		of integers seperated by ONE symbol, but NOT
#		by a space or '#'. The first number labels
#		the trigger item that should be shifted and
#		the second value determins the offset.
#		E.g. the line
#
#			34:	36,-2	44,-1
#
#		would cause item 36 to be shifted by -2 and
#		item 44 by -1 BC given that trigger 34 fired
	
begin StaticOffsetMap
  
2:	1,-2	3,-5	7,2
5:	1,-2	3,-5	7,2
34:	36,2	44,-3

end
