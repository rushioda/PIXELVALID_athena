 *   @short Class helping to decode the MuCTPI data words
 *
 *          The data words of the MuCTPI readout data contain a lot of information
 *          about the LVL1 muon candidates in a tightly encoded fashion. This class
 *          can be used to easily extract all stored information from these 32-bit
 *          words.
 *
 *          For a detailed description of the data format of the MuCTPI, see
 *          the MIROD documentation (https://edms.cern.ch/file/248757/1/mirod.pdf).
