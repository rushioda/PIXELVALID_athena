The file L1TopoDataTypes.vhd is copied from
https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/atl1calo/browser/firmware/L1Topo/ProcessorFPGAs/Algorithms/L1TopoDataTypes.vhd

It describes the hardware limits. As these limitations need to be taken into account during menu generation and
for the simulation, this package L1TopoHardware contains a C++ representation of these parameters

This package should not be touched unless the hardware limitations described in L1TopoDataTypes.vhd are changed.
