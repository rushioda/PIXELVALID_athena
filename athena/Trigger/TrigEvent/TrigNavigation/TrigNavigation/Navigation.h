   * @brief The Navigation class, organizes TriggerElements into the tree structure.

   *
   * The class is providing an interface to the whole navigation. The internal ingredients
   * of the navigation which are TriggerElements are well hidden.
   * All operations on the navigation structure are possible only via trick class.
   * This operations are basically:
   *
   * -# creation of TriggerElements
   *     - creation of the initial (root) node
   *     - creation of RoI nodes (one per RoI, also for secondary RoIs)
   *     - creation of normal nodes (seed by one TriggerElement)
   *     - creation of normal nodes suitable for topological selection (being seed by 2 TriggerElements)
   * .
   * The created nodes are given to user with all the navigational links prepared
   *
   * -# features attaching and retrieval
   *    - attaching feature to node
   *    - attaching feature to RoI node ( therefore all TE originating from node can use it )
   *    - attaching feature to initial (root) node for global (event wide) features
   *    - retrieval of features attached to given node
   *    - retrieval of features attached to given node or any predecessor (back to an initial node)
   *    - retrieval of features attached to given node or any predecessor (traversing back to an initial node)
   *    - retrieval of recent feature attached to given node or any predecessor (traversing back to an initial node)
   *    - retrieval of features attached to RoI nodes of given TriggerElement
   *    - retrieval of features attached to initial (root) node
   * .
   *
   * -# queering methods
   *    - simple queries (isInitial, isTerminal, isRoI)
   *    - more complicated queries for 2 TriggerElements (if they share RoI etc)
   *    - global comparison for 2 navigation structures (needed up to the moment only for validation of serialization)
   *    - query for all TriggerElements of a given type
   * Queries are designed to be usable with STL algorithms.
   *
   *
   * Documentation of EDM related upgrade:
   * -# objects storage
   *    - all possible types are known at compile time (Scott's magic)
   *    - some collections are placed in the SG always independently of the event content
   *    - there can be more collection of given type (one for each user label i.e. number of tracks collections)
   *    - if in navigation config this is given: TrigVertexCollection#HLTAutoKey_T2HistoPrmVtx  --> 
   *      then DataVector<TrigVertexCollection> of label "HLTAutoKey_T2HistoPrmVtx" is placed in the SG in every event
   *    - if in config only type is mentioned TrigVertexCollection#HLTAutoKey ---> 
   *      then  DataVector<TrigVertexCollection> of label HLTAutoKey is placed in SG for each event
   *    - if nothing is mentioned in config the DataVector<TrigVertexCollection> labeled at runtime depending on user labels will be placed in SG (one per label)
   *
   *    - the object of given type are then organized then as follows:
   *      there is many collections of given type per event (each for one label) 
   *      this collections are accessible by label or "SubTypeIndex"
   *      second is to keep the TE -> feature link unchanged if we remove obe of collection during slimming or we simply not record it 
   *
   *     Is is like this
   *     collection of type T |XXXXXXX|       label: ID    subTypeIndex: 0
   *     collection of type T |XXXX|          label: MS    subTypeIndex: 1
   *     collection of type T |XXXXXXXXXXXXX| label: Muons subTypeIndex: 2
   *     collection of type T |XXXXXXXX|      label: Calo  subTypeIndex: 3
   *
   * -# the features <-> TE link
   *    - Features are located in supercontainers DataVector<TrigVertexCollection>
   *    - each label yields in one supercontainer (the unlabeled objects are in the container with HLTAutoKey_ label)
   *    - The link to object in the TE is composed out of 2 numbers CLID, and index
   *    - index (from above) is composed out of 2 parts collection coordinate and second is coordinate within collection
   *    - this way we do not need to touch TE serialization/desetialization
   *    - collection index and inter-collection index are uint16_t word which means we are limited to 65000 collections
   *       of given type and same number of objects in each sub collection
