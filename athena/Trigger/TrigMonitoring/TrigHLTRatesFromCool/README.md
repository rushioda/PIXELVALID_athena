This package is developed to read HLT Rates from the COOL Online repository.

The rates are written to COOL by HLTRates2Cool: https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-tdaq-software/HLTRates2Cool/

COOL folder information can be found at:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasComputing/CoolOnlineData#Folder_TRIGGER_HLT_Chains_CONDBR

These are not accurate rates at a point, but average/approximate rates over a period.
The rates are averaged over 1 minute periods and they start to be written when ATLAS switch to physics mode (ready4physics).
