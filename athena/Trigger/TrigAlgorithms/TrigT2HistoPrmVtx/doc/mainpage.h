@section Introduction

This package performs a very fast primary vertex reconstruction in Z coordinate.

It is currently used in the Bjet slice chain since the computation of likelihood methods
using longitudinal impact parameter needs the estimation of the primary vertex Z coordinate
(for the time being, it is assumed that the primary vertex in the transverse plane is zero).
