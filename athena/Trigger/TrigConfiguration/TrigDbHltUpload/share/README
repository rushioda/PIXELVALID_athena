After the DB was created with the combined-startup script in TrigDb
it can be filled with the provided example by running

xml2db.py -u triguser -n MyTestDB -m host -p trigconfig \
          --l2setup ../XML/examples/HLTSetupL2.xml \
          --efsetup ../XML/examples/HLTSetupEF.xml \
          ../XML/examples/HLTRelease.xml ../XML/examples/HLTSignature.xml ../XML/examples/HLTSequence.xml


available hosts are pcatr07 (Andreas machine) and pcatr13 (Joergs machine)

and you should chose a better name for your database
