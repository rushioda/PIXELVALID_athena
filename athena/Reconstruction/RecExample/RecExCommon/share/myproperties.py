# properties modifier can be put in this file (optional)
# do NOT put there flags settings, they will be ignored !
# just an example
# to use it (myconfig.py and myproperties.py are optional):
# athena -s myconfig.py RecExCommon_topOptions.py myproperties.py >! athena.log
# (in fact easier to ease myTopOptions.py)


# example of property setting
# CBNT_Truth.Enable = False
