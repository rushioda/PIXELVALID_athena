Macro to find SCT Dead and Noisy Channels

--------------------------------------------------------

For a run which is validated as good, start root in this 
directory and run the macro:

.x findbad.c (run)

where run is the run number of the ntuple on castor.

A hit map will be displayed and the noisy and dead channels 
will be printed to screen.

***
The macro is not 100% efficient at spotting the noisy/dead channels
and chips so it might be necessary to compare what is printed
to the hit maps displayed.
***

The bad channel list is also printed to the file 
"softmask_offl_run.txt" in the directory "archive".

In some cases more noisy channels than there really are will
be flagged so if necessary remove some entries from the text
file produced. 

Note that the text file entries are

layer phi side channel status

where status = 2 for noisy and 3 for dead
(status = 0 and 1 are reserved for good and masked in ROD)


Finally, for now the code reflects my opinion of what is a "noisy"
channel, and other people may have their own idea!
