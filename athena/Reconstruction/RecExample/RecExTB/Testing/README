Testing
--------

The automatic test of RecExTB is based on what it is used for RecExCommon.

- To run it: from cmt/ gmake check

- the script_pre_check.sh script is first run

- then athena.py is launched using the RecExTB_Combined_2004_jobOptions.py 
file the outputs being redirected to RecExTBTesting.log 

- finally the script_post_check.sh script is run.
This script searches for ERROR WARNING FATAL and 'Application finalised' 
and the output is saved in RecExTBTesting.log_stripped (and it does the
same for a Reference output file.
The two stripped outputs are then compared and the result is given in
result_check.
