iPatRec Algorithm
-----------------

An athena wrapper to iPatTrackFinder with initialization of the class structure
required for track finding, following and fitting:

     * detector description: - put into iPatGeometry classes
			     - sourced from RD and/or Fornaini
			     
     * magnetic field parametrization from athena MagneticFieldSvc

The underlying TrackFinder, TrackFollower and TrackFitter algorithms are then used
almost unchanged from the atrecon implementation.
    
In addition, the algorithm requires the following data input via Storegate:     

     * SiTrackerClusterContainer's for pixel and SCT detector systems.

     * SiTrackerSpacePointSet with a flat structure containing SiTrackerSpacePoint
       data from both the above detector systems.

TRT track information is associated by use of the TRT_Rec package. Currently
this uses the RD Event and DetDescr.

Tracks are described using the iPatTrack package of data classes. It remains
to persistify these classes (required for alignment/calibration, graphics and
combined reconstruction packages such as MuonIdentification). It is also
foreseen to provide a convertor into SimpleTrack for CBNT purposes.
