	Instructions for release 11.0.0
	==============================

	Firstly update to use the current athena cmt version (if you haven't already done so):
	from $cmthomedir:       'source /afs/cern.ch/sw/contrib/CMT/v1r18p20050501/mgr/setup.sh'
	
	Then after performing the usual command sequence:
	from $cmthomedir:       'source setup.sh ' to set working directory, release and tags;
	from working directory: cmt co Reconstruction/iPat/iPatRecExample;
	                        cd Reconstruction/iPat/iPatRecExample/iPatRecExample-00-20-13/run;
	                        source ../cmt/setup.sh;
				cmt br gmake

	the run directory is now empty. Set up the example by typing:
	                        source ../share/iPatSetup.sh;
				athena.py

	This runs a few Rome-Initial top events.

	To change layout/dataset
	========================
	
	Edit the DetDescrVersion setting in the run/jobOptions.py file
	to be "CTB", "DC1", "DC2", "Rome-Initial" or "Rome-Final" as required

	Some other possibilities in jobOptions.py
	=========================================

	Convert the iPatTracks to Trk::Track
	                    makeESD = True

	Output some standard histograms (into iPatHist.root)		    			    
			    makeHistogs = True

	or write a standard ntuple		    
			    makeNtuple = True

	Configuration for iPatRec.printLevel, minPt, impact parameter cuts, secondary track-finding,
	  magnet off, misaligned data ...		   
 
	How to run a python jobOption
	=============================       
        
        athena.py -b jobOptions.py >! iPat_athena.log  
        athena.py is the standard script which runs athena.exe which is application independent.
        As usual, using ">&" instead of ">" would put the error messages in the log file rather 
        than on the screen                 
         
	Recent change
	=============

	* The default minPt is now 400 MeV for zero-lumi, 1 GeV otherwise
	  It is intended to reduce the minPt to be as low as possible (~150MeV) at start-up
