	* DefaultTools.py: port latest config for JetRecConfig
	* Tagging PFlowUtils-00-00-13

2016-10-03 Teng Jian Khoo <khoo@cern.ch>
	* Use a small weight that's not indistinguishable from 0
	* Tagging as PFlowUtils-00-00-11
	* Option to turn off E/P weight and only remove calo contribution
	* Tagging as PFlowUtils-00-00-12

2016-09-12 Teng Jian Khoo <khoo@cern.ch>
	* Reorganise the weight method and fix the 60 GeV track case again
	* Tagging as PFlowUtils-00-00-10

2016-09-11 Teng Jian Khoo <khoo@cern.ch>
	* Don't weight 60 GeV tracks to 0 unless in dense environment
	* Set tiny but non-zero weights to ensure high-pt cPFOs that are weighted down become jet constituents
	* Needed for PF MET
	* Tagging as PFlowUtils-00-00-09

2016-08-04 Teng Jian Khoo <khoo@cern.ch>
	* Added WeightPFOTool for extraction of charged PFO weights
	* Tagging as PFlowUtils-00-00-08 (missed files in 07 tag)

2016-04-16 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created a new tag with a slightly adjusted CMakeLists.txt
	  file.
	* This is to be able to collect a tag into devval with an
	  explicit CMake configuration.
	* Tagging as PFlowUtils-00-00-06
