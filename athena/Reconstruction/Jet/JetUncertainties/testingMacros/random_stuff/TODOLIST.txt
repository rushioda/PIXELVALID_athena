---JESUncertaintyProvider

- Make sure path works OK
- TDirectory from 2012 in trunk OK
- ? What happens to the Top2012 file? Now it's working because I changed the analysisFile...

---MultijetJESUncertaintyProvider

- Judith's request: NJets-dependent flavour uncertainty OK
   - leaving old file as inclusive, adding (yet another) default argument in flavour composition and response uncertainty OK
   - Dag's suggestions: remove isUp argument, make specialised function for NJets use, otherwise pick up default NO, not yet
[7:22:18 PM] Petit fromage:   //FIXME: isUp argument will be deprecated 
Current situation:
  double getRelFlavorCompUncert(double pT, double eta, bool isUp, unsigned int nJets = 0);
  double getRelFlavorResponseUncert(double pT, double eta, unsigned int nJets = 0);
[7:23:56 PM] Petit fromage: 
Better:
   getRelFlavorCompUncertNjets(double pT, double eta, int nJets);
   getRelFlavorCompUncert(double pT, double eta);

   
- Implementation by default of gluon fraction/gluon fraction uncertainty only OK
   --> documentation (for Joe): 
    1) we need to specify that isUp is not used anywhere
    2) need to write the comments on the .cxx on what we're doing now 
    3) need to write that we CANNOT use the _deprecated function anymore so there is no need for the Rsample 

- When using the Top files, a lot of warnings happen - why? 
  -->OK, figured out and fixed by Steven. 
  -->Switched to (corrected) interpolation 

---Merging of 2011 and 2012 tags

- Check that 2012 configs work in trunk OK

---Twiki & docs

- Check that the getRelUncert function doesn't have pile-up arguments anymore
- Add documentation for path mechanism: Joe
- Clean-up the twikis and prepare for the new tag (but in a sandbox, not in the page itself otherwise people could get confused): Joe doing this

---Config files

--Megafolder JES_2011
- Top 2011 preliminary OK
- JES preliminary 2011, needs folder
- JES final 2011, needs folder and remaking

--Megafolder JES_2012


- have AnalysisInput folder outside, in the share dir  

---Cleaning of content of root files

- 50/50 file might need to 
a. take away rSample
b. remove GCW stuff
