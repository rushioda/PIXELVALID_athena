1. Plotting of the JES uncertainties
------------------------------------

To produce a pdf with plots of the uncertainties corresponding to each config, simply run:

  ./run/plot_all_JES_uncertainties.sh 

It should make nice plots a new folder (it will take a little while).
The script can easily be changed to create specific plots.
After compiling (part of script above), you can for example run:

   ./bin/jes_plots.exe JES_2012/JESUncertainty2012_Sept2012.config JES_2012/MultijetJES_2012.config

to plot the uncertainties corresponding to this configuration.
Note that the path of the config files should be relative to the JetUncertainties/share folder.

2. Example code for uncertainty propagation
-------------------------------------------

Some code that illustrates how to propagate the 2012 HCP uncertainties can be run by:

  ./run/propagate_jes_uncert.sh

This generates some toy dijet events and propagates the 7 JES uncertainty components to the
generated sample. A pdf file is created showing the effect on various kinematic distributions.

One can also run the code with dedicated config files:

  ./run/propagate_jes_uncert.sh PATH_TO_JES_CONFIG PATH_TO_MJES_CONFIG

By default the two files used are the JES recommendaiton for 2012 data released shortly before the HCP conference.


-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Macro to compare correlations for various configurations
-----------------------------------------------------------

Run:

   ./run/compare_correlations.sh

It should be easy to change the input files.
This code is mainly for JES experts.
