Two validation tools for UJUncertaintyProvider are available.

--------------
1. First tool:
--------------

To produce a pdf with plots of the uncertainties, simply run:

  ./run/plot_all_UJU_uncertainties.sh 

It should make nice plots a new folder (it will take a little while).
The script can easily be changed to create specific plots.
After compiling (part of script above), you can for example run:

   ./bin/jes_uju_plots.exe ../share/UJ_2012/JMS2012_Sep232013_DoubleRatio.root AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR30

to plot the uncertainties corresponding to this configuration.
Note that the path of the config files should be relative to the JetUncertainties/share folder.

2. Second tool:
---------------

To produce a pdf with plots of the uncertainties, simply run:

  ./run/test-UJU.sh 

It should make pdf plots in the current folder.
Edit the script to test different rootfiles.
