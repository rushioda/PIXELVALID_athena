@section Introduction

This is the tauRec package. It holds algorithms to reconstruct hadronically decaying tau candidates. The tau reconstruction is using a calorimeter seeded approach. Tracks are collected in a cone around the calorimeter seed and associated to the tau candidate. An own tau energy scale is set.

Packages used by tauRec are listed here:

@htmlinclude used_packages.html

The requirements file for tauRec is shown here:
