Original README
-------------------------------------------------------
The STARlight Monte Carlo models 2-photon and photon-Pomeron interactions
in peripheral heavy ion collisions.  The physics approach for the 2-photon
interactions is described in STAR Note 243. That for the photon-Pomeron
interactions is described in Klein and Nystrand, Phys. Rev. C60, 014903 (1999),
with the p_t spectrum (including vector meson interference) discussed by
Klein and Nystrand in Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2330 (2000).  

STARlight has several input files, all of which are expected to be in the
same directory as the starlight code.  User-specified input parameters are
read from a file named "slight.in"; these parameters are described
below.

The output of the STARlight Monte Carlo can be written to an ascii file
named "slight.out" and in ROOT format (#define root_output if you'd like to have it).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contents of a sample starlight.in file are listed below, with 
explanation.  The user should modify this file according to his or her
needs.

79  197	     // Z, A of the colliding ions (symmetric 
	collisions are assumed)
79  197	     // Z, A of the colliding ions (symmetric 
	collisions are assumed)
100	     // gamma for the colliding ions
4.0 -1 50   // maximum and minimum values for w (the gamma-gamma center of mass
	energy, w = 4(E1)(E2), (a -1 tells STARlight to use the default values
	specified in setConst.f; otherwise, specific wmin here, and the number
        of w bins in the lookup tables
3.0 30	// maximum value for y (y is the rapidity, y = 0.5 ln(E1/E2) ) and the 
        number of y-bins in the cross section calculation 
1	// gg or gP switch -- A 1 here will produce 2-photon channels, a
	// 2 here will produce vector meson channels with a narrow
	//resonance, and a 3 here will produce vector meson channels with
	//a wide (Breit-Wigner) resonance.
10000	// number of events to produce
331	// channel of interest (in PDG notation); currently supported
	options listed below
345738	// random number seed
2	// The form of the output.  A 1 here generates a simple text file.  
        '2' generates a text file in the gstar format
        '3' generates a PAW ntuple.
1	// This number controls the nuclear breakup
        // Note that this option only works for lead or gold; it should work at any energy
	1 = hard sphere nuclei (b>2R)
	2 = both nuclei break up (XnXn)
	3 = a single neutron from each nucleus (1n1n)
	4 = require that neither nucleon break up (with b>2R)
	5 = require that there be no hadronic break up
		(This is similar to option 1, but with the actual hadronic interaction
		probability)
1       0 = no interference (i.e. turned off), 1= interference turned on
0.5     when interference is turned on, this gives the %age interference 0= none, 1=full
1       select coherent/incoherent production for assymetric collisions 
1       scaling factor for incoherent production 
0.24.   when interference is turned on, this is the maximum pt considered
120     when interference is turned on, this is the number of pt bins

Logs:


fixed types for class Particle 
- Int -> Double 
- fixed Makefile .. 
   autoconfig will appear in the future .. make sure paths are fixed before compiling 
   this is for includes and libraries in Makefile
- don't forget about link to pythia xml doc 
  This is located in main.cpp


-Careful with final states.  Upsilon currently goes to mu+mu-, this can be changed in
gammavm.cpp gammaavectormeson::getdaughtermass and in gammaacrosssection::brietwigner.
This applies to psi family as well. Be sure and double check.


- changed PID of the charged KAON to 321 and neutral kaon to 310 .. it should work now for phi -> kk 

- incoherent formfactor was hardcoded for dAu events, it should now accept coherent too.
- Had hardcoded narrow and wide resonances for VMs. The user can again select gg_or_gp (2 or 3)
except for the psi family.  This is still always narrow.
- Changed the spin dependence for VMs going to ee/mumu(gammaavectormeson::gettheta).  It was only for psi and now upsilon will follow too
inretrospect, i should probably have done this first and merge psifamily back into gammaavm.cpp
