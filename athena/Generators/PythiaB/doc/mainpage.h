Interface to Pythia6 dedicated to simulation of beauty events.

PythiaB can be used for a generation of beauty events 
written into a persistent root file, which can serve as an input into 
a detector simulation
(atlsim) or into ATFAST. PythiaB can also work in the same job with ATLFAST 
  in this case the HepMC tree is passed from PythiaB to ATLFAST in
  a transient form.

    The description of pysics related to the PythiaB, as well as instructions how to run PythiaB can be found here:
