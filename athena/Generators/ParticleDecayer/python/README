Some python scripts to quickli inspect the generated EVGEN file.
Because it's desirable to validate that you have generated the events the way you wanted to,
before the full GEANT4, Digitization and Reconstruction steps.

First create an NTUP_TRUTH ROOT file from the EVGEN file:
using asetup 17.2.11.3 run:
Reco_trf.py preExec="rec.doApplyAODFix.set_Value_and_Lock(False);from D3PDMakerConfig.D3PDMakerFlags import D3PDMakerFlags;D3PDMakerFlags.TruthWriteEverything=True" \
inputEVNTFile=<EVGEN.POOL.ROOT file name> \
outputNTUP_TRUTHFile=<NTUP_TRUTH file name>



inspect_truth_file.py:
Usage:
./inspect_truth_file.py -f <path to NTUP_TRUTH file>

This creates a ROOT file named 'histControl.root' which contains histograms of the generated events

Once histControl.root has been created use plotmaker.py to make pdfs of the histograms
Usage:
./plotmaker.py histControl.root
