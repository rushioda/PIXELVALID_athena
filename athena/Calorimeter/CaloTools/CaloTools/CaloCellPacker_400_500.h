/**
 * @brief Calo cell packer/unpacker v400/500.
 *
 * This class handles packing and unpacking of calorimeter cells
 * into a CaloCompactCellContainer.  This holds data as a vector
 * of integers, but for our purposes, we treat it as an array
 * of 16-bit values.  We use the special iterator-like objects
 * that that class defines for access.
 *
 * A summary of the format is given here.  Most constants and bit assignments
 * are specified within the method @c init_header().  Though some of them
 * are spelled out here, the possibility is left open that they can change.
 * The constants are stored in a header along with the data; for reading,
 * those stored constants are the ones used to interpret the data.
 *
 * The difference between versions 400 and 500 is the inclusion
 * of quality and provenance data.
 * Quality is like a chi**2 comparing the observed pulse shape
 * (with 5 samples) to the expected one. It is different cell by cell,
 * event by event (it is like energy and time from this point of view)
 *
 * The idea to store provenance is to know when reading back the ESD
 * how the energy was estimated.
 * For instance, when doing the OFC iteration method on the cosmics on
 * high energy cell there is one bit which tells if the iteration
 * converges or not and this is useful when analyzing back the event
 * (and this bit can vary from event to event for the same cell).
 *
 * The packed data start with an instance of either @c header400
 * or @c header500, containing
 * the packing constants as well as cell/sequence counts.  Note that the
 * first word is the length of the header, in units of @c int.
 *
 * Following the header is a set of @e sequences, each containing
 * a range of cells with consecutive hash IDs.  The cells are stored
 * in hash order, which implies that the subcalorimeters are strictly
 * in the order LAREM, LARHEC, LARFCAL, TILE.  A single sequence
 * contains cells from only a single subcalorimeter.
 *
 * Each sequence starts with a 32-bit value; where the high word
 * is stored first, and the low word second.  (Note that this is
 * @e opposite from the order in which the x86 would naturally store
 * the data.)  The lower 18 bits
 * of this give the hash value of the first cell in the sequence
 * (others follow sequentially), and the upper 14 bits give the number
 * of cells in the sequence.  (Note: if the number of cells in a sequence
 * is more than can be represented in 14 bits, the sequence is simply
 * split into several.)  Following this is the information for the cells
 * themselves.
 *
 * For LAr cells, there is a 16-bit word, containing, starting
 * from the low bit, 12 bits of energy, one sign bit for energy,
 * two bits for the gain, and one bit for the quality.  The quality
 * bit is 1 for good quality and 0 for bad quality.  The gain bits
 * are one of:
 *     0 ENLOW   for LARLOWGAIN
 *     1 ENMED   for LARMEDIUMGAIN, unless cell is in the HEC with e < e1_high
 *     2 ENHIG   for LARHIGHGAIN, unless cell is not in the HEC with e< e1_high
 *     3 EHHIG   for LARMEDIUMGAIN if cell is in the HEC with e < e1_high or
 *               for LARHIGHGAIN if cell is not in the HEC with e < e1_high
 *
 * The maximum energy is taken to be 50 GeV (e1_high) for EHHIG and 3.2 TeV
 * otherwise.  We take the cube root of the absolute value of the energy,
 * convert it into a fraction of fullscale (as a cube root), and store
 * that fraction as a fixed-point number.
 *
 * If the quality is good, this is followed by two additional 16-bit
 * words.  The first gives the time information.  This has 15 bits of time
 * information and one sign bit.  We take the natural log of the time, and then
 * encode this as a fraction of the range from 0.001ns to 1250ns.
 * This is then followed by the quality word.
 *
 * For tile cells, information for each of the two PMTs is stored separately.
 * First is a 16-bit word containing 13 bits of energy information,
 * one sign bit, one gain bit, and one quality bit.  The quality
 * bit is 1 for good quality and 0 for bad.  The gain bit is 0 for
 * low gain and 1 for high gain.  The energy is again stored as
 * a scaled cube root, where the upper limit is 50 GeV for high gain
 * and 3.2 TeV for low gain.   If the quality is good, this is followed
 * by 16 bits of time information, encoded as before.  Following both
 * cells is a 16-bit quality word; the lower 8 bits are for the
 * first PMT, and the upper eight bits are for the second PMT.
 * If the quality flags for both PMTs are bad, then this word
 * is omitted.
 *
 * Following the cell information is the provenance information.
 * Each provenance entry consists of a cell hash code (19 bits)
 * plus a provenance word (13 bits) packed into two 16-bit words.
 * The high 13 bits of the first word are the provenance; the low
 * three bits of the first word plus the second word give the
 * hash code.  Each provenance entry says that cells starting
 * at the given hash code have the given provenance value (until
 * the hash code of the next provenance entry).  Cells with a hash
 * code less than that of the first provenance entry have a provenance
 * word of 0.
 *
 * Version 501 adds a status bitmask to the header, with the flag
 * STATUS_UNORDERED.  This is set if the packer finds that the cells
 * are not in subcalo order.  (This is the case for cell collections
 * produced by the HLT, which are concatenations of per-ROI cell collections.)
 *
 * Version 502 adds quality words and provenance for tile.
 *
 * Version 503 reduces slightly the range for negative energies,
 * to avoid confusion with error flags.
 *
 * Version 504 introduces a flag for SuperCell
