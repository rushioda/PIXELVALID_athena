 * @brief topological cluster maker.
 *
 * Make clusters from CaloCells based on topological neighboring and
 * noise motivated thresholds in units of sigma applied to the
 * absolute value of the energy for each cell.  The clusters will have
 * at least one cell with \f$ E > N_{\rm seed}\,\sigma \f$ (or \f$|E|
 * > N_{\rm seed}\,\sigma \f$ if SeedCutsInAbsE is true).  Cells with
 * \f$ |E| > N_{\rm neighbor}\,\sigma \f$ will expand the cluster by
 * means of their neighbors.  All cells in the cluster must fulfill
 * \f$ |E| > N_{\rm cell}\,\sigma \f$.  The actual clustering is
 * performed by expanding around seed cells. The neighboring cells
 * above neighbor threshold (if not used so far) are stored in a list
 * and used in the next expansion step. The algorithm terminates if no
 * more unused neighbor cells are found.  The final clusters are
 * copied to the cluster collection if they pass the \f$E_\perp\f$ (or
 * \f$|E|_\perp\f$ if SeedCutsInAbsE is true) cut.
 *
 * Like all other cluster maker tools this class derives from
 * CaloClusterCollectionProcessor.  */
