# File: CaloClusterCorrection/python/CaloSwLayers.py
# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Layer variable calculation.
#
# This `correction' is responsible for calculating the layer-by-layer
# variables (position, width, energy) from the list of cells composing
# a cluster.
#
# There are two versions of this correction.
#
# The one with an empty version string is the normal one
# that runs as the first correction
# for any cluster.  It fills the cluster with cells within the proper
# eta/phi window, and calculates the variables.
#
# version='wt' is used when recalculating the layer variables
# after the cells have been reweighted.  It does not recalculate the
# cell list; rather, the existing list is used.  The layer variables
# are recalculated based on these cells.
#

# Create a new tool instance.
#  NAME is the base name for this tool.  If defaulted, a name will
#   be constructed from the name of the correction, the version, and the key.
#  If SUFFIX is not None, it will be added onto the end of the tool name.
#  VERSION is a string specifying which of several versions of the correction
#   to choose.  If defaulted, the latest version of the correction is chosen.
#  KEY is a string to specify the type of cluster to which the correction
#   applies.  The convention is to use `ele55' for 5x5 electron clusters,
#   `gam35' for 3x5 photon clusters, and so on.
#  SOURCE tells from where we should read the calibration constants.
#   See common.py for a description of the possibilities.
#   None means to use the default.
#  CONFCLASS gives the Configurable class to use to create the tool.
#   It may (and usually should) be defaulted.
#
# The following arguments set tool parameters:
#  CELLS_NAME specifies the SG key to use to find the scintillator cells.
#
# Additional keyword arguments may be passed to override any tool
# parameters/constants.
