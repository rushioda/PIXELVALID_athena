# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Crude energy response correction used internally by the v2
#          eta and phi modulation corrections.
#
# In v2 of the corrections, the eta and phi modulation corrections were
# done before the gross energy corrections.  The modulation corrections
# are, however, energy-dependent, and this was handled by doing
# an interpolation in energy.  What one has, however, is the uncorrected
# reconstructed energy, while what one would like to use for the interpolation
# is the true energy.  For the modulation corrections, the difference
# between these two made an observable difference.  This was dealt with
# by first scaling the energy by a crude, eta-dependent factor to get
# the energy approximately correct to use for the interpolation.
#
# In the v3 corrections, the modulation corrections were moved to after
# the gross energy corrections, so this was no longer an issue for those
# corrections.  (It is, however, still an issue for the position corrections.
# The same strategy is still used there, though the implementation is
# a bit different.)
