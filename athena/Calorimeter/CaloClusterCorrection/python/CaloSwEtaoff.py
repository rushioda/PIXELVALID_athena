# File: CaloClusterCorrection/python/CaloSwEtaoff.py
# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Steering module for eta position (s-shape) corrections.
#
# Due to the cell structure of the calorimeter, measurements in eta
# are biased towards the cell center.  There will also be other biases
# near edges and cracks.  This is sometimes called the S-shape correction,
# after how the bias looks when plotted.  This correction attempts
# to remove these biases.
#
# In general, this is done by fitting an empirical function that evolves
# as a function of eta.  The details of how this is done has changed
# significantly with time.  For more details, see the C++ header files
# for the individual versions.

#
# Create a new tool instance.
#  SAMPLING is the calorimeter sampling (EMB1, EMB2, EME1, EME2) to which
#   this correction will be applied.
#  NAME is the base name for this tool.  If defaulted, a name will
#   be constructed from the name of the correction, the version, and the key.
#  If SUFFIX is not None, it will be added onto the end of the tool name.
#  VERSION is a string specifying which of several versions of the correction
#   to choose.  If defaulted, the latest version of the correction is chosen.
#  KEY is a string to specify the type of cluster to which the correction
#   applies.  The convention is to use `ele55' for 5x5 electron clusters,
#   `gam35' for 3x5 photon clusters, and so on.
#  SOURCE tells from where we should read the calibration constants.
#   See common.py for a description of the possibilities.
#   None means to use the default.
#  CONFCLASS gives the Configurable class to use to create the tool.
#   It may (and usually should) be defaulted.
#
# Additional keyword arguments may be passed to override any tool
# parameters/constants.
