# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Steering module for phi modulation corrections.
#
# The response of the calorimeter varies slightly depending on the
# position of the particle impact in phi relative to the accordion
# absorber structure.  This correction attempts to remove this variation.
#
# Note, however, that the inherent uncertainties in energy and phi
# measurement --- including the phi smearing due to bremsstrahlung
# and the 1/\sqrt{E} behavior of the energy resolution --- will tend
# to smear this effect out, especially for lower energies.  We can only
# correct for the portion that's visible after the smearing.
#
# The correction is derived in the following way.
# First the calorimeter is binned in eta, to separate regions of the
# calorimeter that have different energy response behaviors.
# In each of these bins, for each particle, we take the measured phi
# position and convert it to an offset within the absorber structure,
# phi_cell.  (This is done by taking the modulus with respect to the phi size
# of the absorbers, which is 2pi/1024 in the barrel and 2pi/768
# in the endcap, corresponding to four and three absorbers per cell,
# respectively.)  If eta is negative, the sign of phi is flipped.
# We then plot R = E_meas/E_true versus phi_cell.
# This plot is binned in phi_cell.  In each of these bins, we project
# the R values to a 1-d histogram and fit a Gaussian.  The range for
# this fit is either 0.8 or 0.9 to 1.0, depending on the |eta| position.
# Finally, the mean from this fit and its uncertainty are plotted versus
# phi)cell to produce the phi-modulation plot.
#
# These plots are then fit with this functional form:
#
#  1 + A[alpha cos(N phi+C) + (1-alpha)cos(2N phi+D)],
#
# where alpha = atan B/pi + 1/2, and N is the total number of
# absorbers in 2pi (either 1024 or 768, depending on |eta|).

# Create a new tool instance.
#  NAME is the base name for this tool.  If defaulted, a name will
#   be constructed from the name of the correction, the version, and the key.
#  If SUFFIX is not None, it will be added onto the end of the tool name.
#  VERSION is a string specifying which of several versions of the correction
#   to choose.  If defaulted, the latest version of the correction is chosen.
#  KEY is a string to specify the type of cluster to which the correction
#   applies.  The convention is to use `ele55' for 5x5 electron clusters,
#   `gam35' for 3x5 photon clusters, and so on.
#  SOURCE tells from where we should read the calibration constants.
#   See common.py for a description of the possibilities.
#   None means to use the default.
#  CONFCLASS gives the Configurable class to use to create the tool.
#   It may (and usually should) be defaulted.
#
# Additional keyword arguments may be passed to override any tool
# parameters/constants.
