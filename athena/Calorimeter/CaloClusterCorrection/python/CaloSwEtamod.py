# File: CaloClusterCorrection/python/CaloSwEtamod.py
# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Steering module for eta modulation corrections.
#
# There is also a small dependence of the calorimeter energy response
# on the eta offset of the particle impact within a calorimeter cell.
# This is due at least partly to the fact that more energy leaks
# outside of the cluster window the impact is near the edge of the center cell
# than when it is near the center.
#
# The binning and the procedure for extracting the modulations is the same
# as for the phi modulation case.  Within each bin, we fit a quadratic.
# It is seen that if we restrict ourselves to regions of the calorimeter
# away from non-uniformities, then the extracted fit parameters
# are generally consistent.  Accordingly, to derive
# this correction, we combine together all the uniform bins and fit to
# that.

# Create a new tool instance.
#  NAME is the base name for this tool.  If defaulted, a name will
#   be constructed from the name of the correction, the version, and the key.
#  If SUFFIX is not None, it will be added onto the end of the tool name.
#  VERSION is a string specifying which of several versions of the correction
#   to choose.  If defaulted, the latest version of the correction is chosen.
#  KEY is a string to specify the type of cluster to which the correction
#   applies.  The convention is to use `ele55' for 5x5 electron clusters,
#   `gam35' for 3x5 photon clusters, and so on.
#  SOURCE tells from where we should read the calibration constants.
#   See common.py for a description of the possibilities.
#   None means to use the default.
#  CONFCLASS gives the Configurable class to use to create the tool.
#   It may (and usually should) be defaulted.
#
# Additional keyword arguments may be passed to override any tool
# parameters/constants.
