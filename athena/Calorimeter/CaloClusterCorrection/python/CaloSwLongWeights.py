# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Steering module for longitudinal weights corrections.
#
# This module is used to set up the longitudinal weight correction.
# This correction scales the energies of layers 0 and 3 by constants,
# then applies a linear transformation (scale plus offset) to the resulting
# energy.  All four of these constants are eta-dependent
# (but not energy-dependent).
#
# Note that for any given eta, we should apply either the gap or the LW
# correction, but not both.  For some versions of the corrections, that
# wasn't true.  See the comments in the individual versions for more
# about hacks that were used to deal with this.
#
# The entry point for this module is make_CaloSwLongWeights, which
# returns a new correction tool.  The available versions are given
# in the table below.

# Create a new tool instance.
#  NAME is the base name for this tool.  If defaulted, a name will
#   be constructed from the name of the correction, the version, and the key.
#  If SUFFIX is not None, it will be added onto the end of the tool name.
#  VERSION is a string specifying which of several versions of the correction
#   to choose.  If defaulted, the latest version of the correction is chosen.
#  KEY is a string to specify the type of cluster to which the correction
#   applies.  The convention is to use `ele55' for 5x5 electron clusters,
#   `gam35' for 3x5 photon clusters, and so on.
#  SOURCE tells from where we should read the calibration constants.
#   See common.py for a description of the possibilities.
#   None means to use the default.
#  CONFCLASS gives the Configurable class to use to create the tool.
#   It may (and usually should) be defaulted.
#
# Additional keyword arguments may be passed to override any tool
# parameters/constants.
