# File: CaloClusterCorrection/python/CaloSwRfac.py
# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Steering module for R-factor correction.
#
# Some corrections, such as the position correction, are energy-dependent,
# but they need to run before the energy correction is done.  This causes
# a problem: the energy-dependence of these corrections is handled
# by finding the correction at several different true cluster energies,
# and then interpolating.  The value that we'd want to use for the
# interpolation is the true cluster energy.  However, all we have
# is the uncorrected reconstructed energy, which is systematically off
# from the true energy by a significant amount.
#
# To deal with this circularity, we first (before the position corrections)
# apply a crude energy correction to get the scale approximately correct.
# This corrected energy is then used for the interpolation in the
# position corrections.  When the layer update pass is run, the correction
# we make here gets undone.
#
# This `R-factor' correction simply scales the total cluster energy
# by an eta-dependent constant.  This is typically derived from
# 100 GeV electrons/photons.

# Create a new tool instance.
#  NAME is the base name for this tool.  If defaulted, a name will
#   be constructed from the name of the correction, the version, and the key.
#  If SUFFIX is not None, it will be added onto the end of the tool name.
#  VERSION is a string specifying which of several versions of the correction
#   to choose.  If defaulted, the latest version of the correction is chosen.
#  KEY is a string to specify the type of cluster to which the correction
#   applies.  The convention is to use `ele55' for 5x5 electron clusters,
#   `gam35' for 3x5 photon clusters, and so on.
#  SOURCE tells from where we should read the calibration constants.
#   See common.py for a description of the possibilities.
#   None means to use the default.
#  CONFCLASS gives the Configurable class to use to create the tool.
#   It may (and usually should) be defaulted.
#
# Additional keyword arguments may be passed to override any tool
# parameters/constants.
