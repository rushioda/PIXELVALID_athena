# File: CaloClusterCorrection/python/CaloSwEtamod_v2.py
# Created: Nov 2006, sss
# Purpose: Eta modulation corrections, v2.
#
# These corrections were derived using DC2 MC files reconstructed
# with 8.x.0.  Electrons at 50, 100, and 200 GeV were used.
# Derived for 5x5 clusters only.
#
# This was added in LArClusterRec-02-05-25, in 9.0.3.
#
# Two versions of this correction are exported.
# The original (v2) version of this correction ran before the
# gross energy correction.  Therefore, when the energy interpolation
# was performed, the energy was scaled with a crude eta-dependent
# factor.  For v3 of the corrections, the modulation corrections
# were moved to after the gross energy corrections.  Accordingly,
# this crude energy correction was turned off (by setting the
# correction factor to unity).
#
# v3 of the correction was in CaloClusterCorrection-00-02-58, in 12.0.3.
