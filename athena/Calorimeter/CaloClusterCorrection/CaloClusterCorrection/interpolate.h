/**
 * @brief Polynomial interpolation in a table.
 * @param a Interpolation table.
 *          The x values are in the first column (column 0),
 *          and by default, the y values are in the second column (column 1).
 *          The x values must be in ascending order, with no duplicates.
 * @param x The value to interpolate.
 * @param degree The degree of the interpolating polynomial.
 * @param ycol The column number of the y values.  (0-based.)
 * @param regions Sometimes, you want to divide the range being interpolated
 *                into several distinct regions, where the interpolated
 *                function may be discontinuous at the boundaries
 *                between regions.  To do this, supply this argument,
 *                which should contain a list (in ascending order)
 *                of the x-coordinates of the region boundaries.
 *                When the interpolation runs against a boundary,
 *                the algorithm will add a copy of the last point
 *                before the boundary, positioned at the boundary.
 *                This helps to control runaway extrapolation
 *                leading up to the boundary.
 * @param n_points The number of interpolation points in the table to use.
 *                 If -1, then the entire table is used.
 * @return The interpolated value.
 *
 * The method used is Newtonian interpolation.
 * Based on the cernlib routine divdif.
