/**
 * @class CaloSwEtaoff_v3
 * @brief EM calorimeter eta offset (S-shape) corrections, version 3.
 *
 * The measured cluster eta positions are biased towards the centers
 * of the cells.  This correction attempts to remove this bias.
 *
 * If you plot @f$\Delta\eta = \eta_{\rm true} - \eta_{\rm measured}@f$
 * as a function of @f$\eta@f$, the result is nearly periodic in the
 * cell structure.  We model this by binning the plots in @f$|\eta|@f$,
 * fitting an empirical function to the bins, and then interpolating
 * the fit parameters in @f$|\eta|@f$ in order to extend the function
 * over the entire range.
 *
 * For purposes of this correction, the calorimeter is divided
 * into disjoint regions in @f$\eta@f$; the correction is applied separately
 * in each region.  The region boundaries were set by looking
 * at where the behavior of the @f$\eta@f$ correction changes
 * discontinuously (so the regions are large in uniform regions
 * and small near cracks).
 *
 * Within each region, the correction is based on an empirical
 * function of the offset @f$u@f$ of the cluster within the cell,
 * where @f$u=0@f$ is at the center, and @f$u=\pm 1@f$ are the edges.
 * The function also depends on a set of parameters, @f$A@f$, @f$B@f$,
 * and so on.
 * Each of these parameters is then taken as a polynomial
 * in $\eta$, with coefficients $A_i$, $B_i$, and so on.  These coefficients
 * are the parameters of the correction.  There is one set
 * of these coefficients per region per energy.
 *
 * There are several different empirical functions implemented.
 * Each is identified by a small integer number.
 * (Note that some functional forms tried in the analysis were
 * not used in the final result and were not implemented here;
 * thus, there are gaps in the numbering.)
 *
 * Form 0 is as follows: @f[
 *
 *      f(u) = A\left[\tan^{-1} Bu + C_{\pm}u + E\right],
 *
 * @f] where @f$C_{\pm}=C@f$ if @f$u\ge0@f$ and @f$C_{\pm}=D@f$
 * if @f$u<0@f$.
 *
 * The second implemented form is form 3.  This form
 * is the same as Form 0 with the constraint @f$f(-1)=f(1)@f$: @f[
 *
 *      f(u) = A\left[\tan^{-1} Bu + C_{\pm}u + E\right],
 *
 * @f] where @f$C_{\pm}=C@f$ if @f$u\ge0@f$ and
 * @f$C_{\pm}=-C-2\tan^{-1} B@f$ if @f$u<0@f$.
 *
 * The next implemented form is form 4.   This form
 * is the same as used in the V2 corrections; it is equivalent
 * to Form 0 with the constraints @f$f(-1)=f(1)=0@f$: @f[
 *
 *           f(u) = A\left[{u\tan^{-1} B - \tan^{-1} Bu \over
 *                      (Z/B)\tan^{-1} B - \tan^{-1} Z} + C(1-|u|)\right],
 *
 * @f] where @f[
 *
 *           Z = \sqrt{B\over \tan^{-1} B - 1}.
 *
 * @f]
 *
 * The next implemented form is form 5.   This form is a simple
 * polynomial in @f$|\eta|@f$
 *
 * The next implemented form is form 10.   This is based
 * on form 3, with the addition of a sinusoidal term, to absorb
 * remaining residual.  In addition, linear terms are added
 * in the regions @f$|u|>0.9@f$ in order to assure continuity
 * at the edges.  So: @f[
 *
 *      f(u) = A\left[\tan^{-1} Bu + C_{\pm}u + E\right] +
 *             \alpha\cos(\beta\pi u + \gamma) + \Delta,
 *
 * @f], where @f$C_{\pm}=C@f$ if @f$u\ge0@f$ and
 * @f$C_{\pm}=-C-2\tan^{-1} B@f$ if @f$u<0@f$; 
 * @f$\delta=\alpha(\cos(\beta\pi+\gamma)-\cos(-\beta\pi+\gamma))@f$;
 * and @f$\Delta= - (u-0.9)/0.1\times \delta/2@f$ if $u>0.9$,
 * @f$\Delta= (-0.9-u)/0.1\times \delta/2@f$ if $u<-0.9$,
 * and @f$\Delta=0@f$ otherwise.
 *
 * The next implemented form is form 11.   This is based
 * on form 0, with the addition of a sinusoidal term, to absorb
 * remaining residual.  So: @f[
 *
 *      f(u) = A\left[\tan^{-1} Bu + C_{\pm}u + E\right] +
 *             \alpha\cos(\beta\pi u + \gamma),
 *
 * @f], where @f$C_{\pm}=C@f$ if @f$u\ge0@f$ and @f$C_{\pm}=D@f$
 * if @f$u<0@f$.
 *
 * To apply the correction, we first find the proper region.
 * Then, we loop over each energy for which the correction
 * was tabulated.  For some energies, we may have not had
 * enough statistics to get a reliable fit; those energies
 * are skipped.  Otherwise, we evaluate the polynomials for
 * the function parameters and then evaluate the empirical
 * function.  This gives us a list of corrections per energy.
 * To get the final correction, we interpolate using the
 * cluster energy.  (The energy should already have had
 * at least a crude correction.)
