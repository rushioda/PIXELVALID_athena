   * @brief definition of all dimensions used for out-of-cluster corrections
   * 
   * The currently defined dimensions are:
   *
   * side: negative values for eta < 0 and positive for eta > 0; 1 bin
   * from -1.5 to 1.5 for no side dependency
   *
   * |eta|: the absolute value of eta; normally in ATLAS the bounds
   * are within [0,5], smaller ones are useful for test beam setups.
   *
   * phi: the phi range; 1 bin from -pi to pi for no phi dependency
   *
   * log10(E_clus^EMnoPSnoGap3): the log10 of the cluster energy on EM
   * scale without pre-samplers and gap scintillators; typical range
   * should be within the generated energy range of single pions with
   * about 50% room to the maximum created energy - i.e. use log10(1
   * TeV) as max value if you generated up tp 2 TeV pions
   *
   * log10(lambda_clus): the log10 of the cluster depth in the
   * calorimeter; typical ranges are from 0 to 4
   *
   * weight: the ratio E_outOfCluster/E_clus^EMnoPSnoGap3/Isolation;
   * the bounds define the level of truncation for the weights
   * to suppress noise and bad sampling ratios. Typical bounds are 0.
   * to 5.
