   * @brief definition of all dimensions used for each sampling
   * 
   * Since samplings can be present or not, the samplings itself are
   * defined via the special first dimension which has to be exactly 1
   * bin with the title of the sampling and the bounds of the
   * CaloSample enum. 
   *
   * The remaining dimensions are:
   *
   * side: negative values for eta < 0 and positive for eta > 0; 1 bin
   * from -1.5 to 1.5 for no side dependency
   *
   * |eta|: the absolute value of eta; normally in ATLAS the bounds
   * are within [0,5], most samplings need smaller ranges and even
   * smaller ones for test beam setups.
   *
   * phi: the phi range; 1 bin from -pi to pi for no phi dependency
   *
   * log10(E_clus): the log10 of the cluster energy; typical range
   * should be within the generated energy range of single pions with
   * about 50% room to the maximum created energy - i.e. use log10(1
   * TeV) as max value if you generated up tp 2 TeV pions
   *
   * log10(rho_cell): the cell energy density (either truth or reco);
   * typical ranges are from -7 to 1
   *
   * weight: the ratio E_true/E_rec (or E_rec/E_true for inversion
   * method; the bounds define the level of truncation for the weights
   * to suppress noise and bad sampling ratios. Typical bounds are 0.5
   * to 3,5, or 10 without inversion method, where 5 and 10 are used
   * for HEC and Tile, respectively. With inversion mewthod the bounds
   * are -2 to 3.
