CaloRecEx is a testing (ATN and RTT) package for the reconstruction in the Calorimeter.


The RTT use :

- didAnyTestFail.py : check the results of the tests (CaloRecEx_histComp.C,CaloRecEx_truth.C) and send an email to the people defined in http://marwww.in2p3.fr/~kbernard/caloperf/CaloRecEx_mails.txt
- extractRec.py : extract cputime, memory, file size informations, memory leaks. It sends an email with the results of the tests. A test is defined like

Name of the test : reference logfile
1103_T1_McAtNLO_top:reflogRec1103_T1_McAtNLO_top

and you have to add a line
print "BEGIN_RTTINFO = 1103_T1_McAtNLO_top"
in the jobOption of this test.


- CaloRecEx_histComp.C : comparison of histograms 

- CaloRecEx_truth.C : plots for truth 



CaloRecEx_histComp.C and CaloRecEx_truth.C need paramaters which are defined in a file 1103_T1_McAtNLO_top.par (for the test 1103_T1_McAtNLO_top) stored in http://marwww.in2p3.fr/~kbernard/caloperf/
