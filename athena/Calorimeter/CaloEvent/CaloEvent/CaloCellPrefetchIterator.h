 * @brief Interface to @c NavigableToken weights.  No-weight version.

 * We want our iterator to work with both @c NavigableToken iterators
 * and normal iterators.  The key difference is that @c NavigableToken
 * also has a weight attached to each element.  In that case, we need
 * to save weights in the iterator, like we do below for cell pointers.
 * However, we don't want to do that in the case where we don't
 * actually have weights.
 *
 * Thus, we break out the part handing the weights into a base class
 * of @c CaloCellPrefetchIterator.  We recognize the @c NavigableToken
 * case because its iterator has a special @c iterator_category.
 * So, we have a specialized version of the @c paramholder class
 * for this case.  The unspecialized case handles the case
 * where there are no weights.  It's empty, so when used as a base
 * class, should not increase the size of the iterator.
 *
 * This is the unspecialized case.

/*
 * @brief To iterate over @a CaloCell's, prefetching the detector description.
 *
 * A typical use of @a CaloCell's is to iterate over a container of them;
 * for each cell, we then call methods on the detector descriptor element
 * for that cell.  It will often be the case, though, that the DDE data
 * are not in cache when first accessed.  This will show up in profiles
 * as the first DDE accessor method taking much longer than subsequent ones.
 *
 * A way to mitigate this is to use the prefetch feature of the x86 CPUs.
 * At the start of the loop, we look ahead at the next cell to be processed
 * and issue a prefetch for its DDE.  The prefetch itself won't stall, and
 * when we come around to the next iteration of the loop, it is likely
 * that the DDE data are now in cache.
 *
 * Here is an example of how to use this:
 *
 *@code
   CONTAINER container = ...;
   CaloCellPrefetchIterator<CONTAINER::const_iterator> it
     (container.begin(), container.end());
   while (it.next()) {
     const CaloCell* cellp = *it;
   }
 @endcode
 *
 * If the container is a @a NavigableToken, you can also get the parameter
 * with <code>it.getParameter()</code>.
 *
 * As a convenience, you can also say
 *
 *@code
   CaloCellPrefetchIterator<CONTAINER::const_iterator> it  (container);
 @endcode
 *
 * Note that there must be no null pointers in the collection.
 *
 * Also note that the prefetch instructions won't actually be generated
 * unless -msse is used during compilation.  (This is for x86; other
 * architectures may require other switches.)
 *
 * (Originally, the intention was to make this be a STL-style iterator
 * so that it could be a drop-in replacement.  It proved impractical
 * to do it that way and have it also be efficient and robust.)
 *
 * Because iterators may be heavy-weight (such as for
 * @c NavigableTokenIterator), we keep only the current and end
 * iterators here.  We separately cache the cell pointers (and weights)
 * for the current and next elements.  We're careful to only
 * do the iterator comparison once per loop.
