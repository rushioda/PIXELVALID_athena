This package contains the base classes of common utility for the MuonCabling
packages. Moreover the BaseObject class is also inerithed by the classes 
performing the Level-1 muon trigger simulation. Two sets of library are built:
MuonCablingTools to be used into the ATHENA framework, and CablingTools to be 
used into a standalone application.


Basic components:

BaseObject : is the base class from which most of the other classes are built.
             It handles data member of geral use (name,object type) plus the
             interface with the messaging services.

dbline     : utility class for building a modular reading routine. The
             type of serch pattern is: <Token> <set of data>.

MessageStream : class that handles the characters set used for composing a 
                message
