With these scripts you can create a new user account, create all objects of the calibration schema and delete them and load data into the tables of the schema (except MDT_RT_CHEBY table, there are no example of data file). 
If you want create a new account use the CREATE_USER.sql script as it follows:

sqlplus sys/PASSWD @create_user.sql <user_name> <site_name> (2 characters like MU,MI,RM...) <user_password> <user_default_tablespace> <user_default_temporary_tablespace>

if you want to use your account, please check if it has all privileges listed in the create_user.sql script.
About the schema, you find scripts to create any object, and you can create the whole schema running:

sqlplus <USER>/<PASSWORD> @create_schema.sql <USER> <SITE INITIAL> <PASSWORD> <TABLESPACE>

The log file will be in create_schema_spool.log. 
To delete all the objects in the schema run:

sqlplus <USER>/<PASSWORD> @drop_all_schema_objects_11.sql <USER>

To load data in the tables use the SQL-Loader utility with control files and data files in the load_data directory. Run the sqlldr command from the ATLAS_MDT_Calibration_DB_1.1 directory, for example to load data into MDT_HEAD table run:

sqlldr <USER>/<PASSWORD> control=load_data/mdt_head.ctl

the log file of the loading will be mdt_head.log.

Then, the do_all script performs the following actions:

- creates all the new objects
- loads data into any table (except MDT_RT_CHECBY)

then it does not drop the objects, to use it run:

./do_all <USER_NAME> <SITE_NAME>(2 characters like MU,MI,RM...) <USER_PASSOWRD> <TABLESPCE_NAME>
