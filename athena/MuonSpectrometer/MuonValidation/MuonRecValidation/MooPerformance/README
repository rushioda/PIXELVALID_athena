  MooPerformance package is meant to contain ROOT (or PAW) macros
  to study Moore and MuID performance. See results in the
  validation web pages located at http://cern.ch/muondoc/Software/Validation/.

  This version of the package includes macros for the study
  of single-muon MC events based on the CBNT ntuples created by
  MooMakeNtuplePulls, MuidInitNtuple, MuidIDNtuple, MuidNtuple, MuidCombNtuple
  and MuidNtupleKINE

    MooPerformance.C	main ROOT function to steer analysis
    MooHists.C		loops over CBNT tree to fill a variety of histograms   
    PhiBin.C            Defines 4 regions in phi (A,B1,C,B2) as defined in 
                        ATL-SOFT-2003-007. 

  Note: Previous tags included MooHists.C that expected a single ntuple and
    MooHists2 that expected Moore ntuples to be in tree t4444 and Muid 
    ntuples in t3333. MooHists2 has been renamed MooHists and the previous 
    MooHists removed.( TBM 11/11/04)

  The performance plots can be run in batch mode with:

    root -q -b MooPerformance.C

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Addition for RTT Moore-MoMu studies
 
  A new macro called MoMuPlot.C has been introduced to analyse the 
  TrackAnalysis.root file in output from CalibrationNtuple
  Relevant plots are generated for validation and performance studies of 
  Moore-MoMu. 
  Again , this is run simply by doing
   root -q -b MoMuPlot.C
