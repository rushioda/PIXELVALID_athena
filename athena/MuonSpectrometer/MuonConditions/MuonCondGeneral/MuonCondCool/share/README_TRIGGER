How to use makeRpcTriggerScripts.py script.
-------------------------------------------

The makeRpcTriggerScripts.py script is handling the writing of RPC trigger 
thresholds for all sector logics (s00-s63) into the Cool db.

It can be executed with command
	   python makeRpcTriggerScripts.py

Currently the trigger thresholds are taken from 
   "/afs/cern.ch/atlas/testbeam/muontbh8/scratch03/Monica2/Trigger/"
(this can be changed in variable "inputfolder" if needed).
Script loops over all Eta and Phi s00-s63 subdirectories and for each
of the input files it creates a python script (based on Trigger_Write.py script), e.g. 

TriggerWriteEta_s00_t0_ph_c2.py  TriggerWritePhi_s00_t0_ph_c0.py
TriggerWriteEta_s00_t0_pl_c2.py  TriggerWritePhi_s00_t0_ph_c1.py
TriggerWriteEta_s00_t1_ph_c2.py
.......
which are put into a "scripts" directory which is created automatically.
This step is rather fast (till now nothing is written into database).


Then one just needs to execute the scripts in a shell one by one for
instance with a bash command
    cd scripts
    for i in `ls *py`; do athena $i; done
(of course one needs to put the authentication.xml file into the
"scripts" directory).
