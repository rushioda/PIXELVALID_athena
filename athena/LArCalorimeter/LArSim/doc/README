This package contains the infrastructure
(a Maker and a Producer classes) to create 
and populate LArHits in the Transient Event
Store of ATHENA .

The LAr Hit classes are defined in the package
LArSimEvent . 

A user willing to handle existing hits,
should make use of LArSimEvent/ILArHit as much as possible, 
since this generic interface guaranties a better
insulation against the implementation details.

A user who would like to create new hits 
from an Athena  algorithm in the
TDS , has only to write a specialized 
LArHitProducer. 


An example of how to write a specific 
LArHitProducer is provided in LArFakeClusterProducer .
It creates fake clusters in the EM barrel . 



To execute an example program :

 
  Create a new working CMT directory .
  Read ``CMT in ATLAS'' if you are not familiar with CMT .
  Use the TestRelease method to create a run time environment .
  
  
 
To execute the example program:

 1) in the file TestRelease/TestRelease-xx-yy-zz/cmt/requirements" add the lines :
 
  use Control Control-*
  use Event   Event-*
  use Generators Generators-* 
  use LArCalorimeter-* 
 
 2) then , in the cmt directory under TestRelease/TestRelease-xx-yy-zz , execute :
 
    cmt config
    source setup.sh
    gmake
 
 2) in directory "TestRelease/TestRelease-xx-yy-zz/run/"
