/**
 * @file  LArCalibUtils/LArPhysWaveBuilder.h
 * @brief Build LAr wave shapes from real data.
 *
 * The LAr electronics samples the pulse from the detector
 * at intervals of 25ns.  When the RODs are run in the mode
 * where these individual samples are read out, we can use this
 * to try to measure the shape of the pulse.  It works better
 * if there's some dispersion in the trigger times, to allow
 * measuring the shape at a continuum of times, rather than
 * just at integral multiples of 25ns.
 *
 * This algorithm accumulates these measured pulse shapes
 * for each individual cell and gain.  The results can be
 * saved to the conditions database or dumped to a ROOT file.
