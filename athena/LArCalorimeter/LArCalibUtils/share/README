LArCalibUtils jobOptions
==============================================================================

All jobOptions fragments used to to steer the execution of the
LArCalibUtils algorithms are now collected in a dedicate package
called:

LArCalorimeter/LArExample/LArCalibProcessing

LArCalibUtils will no longer contain any jobOptions, since these files
are changing more frequently that the code itself (e.g. because of
database tag or folder name changes).

IMPORTANT: Dear developers, if you introduce any change in the code that
           implies a jobOptions variation (e.g. a new algorithm
           property), please update accordingly the corresponding
	   jobOptions fragment in LArCalibProcessing, and notify the
           change (and the new tag of both packages) in the ChangeLog 
           files of both LArCalibUtils and LArCalibProcessing!
