LArCalibProcessing jobOptions (last update: 08/05/2008)
==============================================================================

* 'P3C' jobOptions:

These are the most up-to-date jobOptions fragments for all the
electronics calibration jobs (the ones you should use!). The
Electronic Calibration developers are taking care to migrate them to
the latest reelase, see the following list for compatibility.

Please note that all these jobOptions file are NOT supposed to
modified directly: all default settings can be externally set on the
Athena command line, or trough a topOptions file. Examples for the
different jobs are provided, please refer to them for guidelines.

* 'CTB04' jobOptions:

These are still here for hystorical reasons, even if they are
certainly outdated and might not run on latest releases.

* 'Example' jobOptions:

There are 'uncommon' jobOptions documenting the possibile use cases of
special algorithms. They might well be outdated.
